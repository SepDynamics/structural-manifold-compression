The Final system is not the interferometer that Mitchell had suspected; it simply detects the angle of reflection. A silk-like beam of light is projected across the groove so that the upper part of the beam falls on the \"land\" at the top of the groove, while the lower half falls on the groove wall. The reflection of the land is detected and used by a servo to maintain the optical system at a constant height above the surface of the record. The reflection of the groove wall is detected and forms the analog data signal.\n\nThe key to the system is the \"position-sensitive detectors, or PSDs. Each is a long narrow row of CCD elements similar to those in a video camera. The scanning circuits associated with the CCD array produce two voltages, one proportional to the position of a cell along the two (X) and another proportional to the intensity of the light striking that cell (I). By multiplying X times I and adding, the circuit calculates the intensity-weighted average position of the reflected image, with an example of about one-tenth the width of the spot. From the geometry of the situation, it is easy to show that X is proportional to the tangent of 2A (where A is the groove-modulation angle), and for normally small angles it is linearly proportional to the groove-modulation velocity (which is what the mechanical synthesis in a conventional magnetic pickup detects).\n\nThis method has one obvious limitation. The angle between the projected laser beam and its reflection is *not* the groove modulation angle. With normal modulations this is fine, but if the groove angle exceeds 45 degrees the reflection angle exceeds 90 degrees, meaning that the reflection never makes it back across the groove to the detector. In fact, at Final amplitude, the PSD accommodates groove angles only in the 38 degrees larger modulations are handled by a different technique. (They didn't explain this; its part of the turntable's operation remains a mystery.)\n\nThe Final turntable has a full complement of CD-like controls that provide automatic tuning to the start of any band, elapsed- and remaining-time display, programmable random-access playback, automatic repeat, and other conveniences. And it contains a tick-and-pop apparatus that works very well. The playback speed is continuously adjustable from 33 to 50 rpm. It won't handle 78s, but there is strong demand for a future version that would—at the player even see the light of day. Would the laser turntable be popular among audiophiles? Mitchell and Moran guessed that it might get the same reception as the Shure V-15 cartridge, respected for its accuracy but lacking the ubiquitous qualities of the best MC players. (This prompted Michael Shutters to observe that in comparing two pickups that are identical except for stubs synapse—causal vs. van den Hul—the main difference, surprisingly, seemed not to be in the highs but in low/midrange definition, perhaps because of a difference in the way the stubs synks into the groove wall.)\n\n**Blind listening tests**\n\nDavid Clark organized blind listening tests at the AES convention. In one, three amplifiers were compared (a Crown pro model, a VTL tube amp, and a Threshold FET amp), driving large Infinity speakers. In another, Belden 10-gauge and Monster M1000 speaker cable were compared. In a third, Peter Sultem switched varying amounts of phase shift and nonlinear distortion into the signal path. About half of the total population of engineers guessed correctly in the amp and cable comparison, a result consistent with random guessing. But a small subset of listeners scored very high, supporting their own claim to hear the amp and difference reliably.\n\nAt the end of the convention these results were discussed by painless seated test for night a座谈会. Noel Lee (Monster), Michael Fremel (*The Absolute Sound*, In Eales (a cable between) Peter Sultem, Eugene Pitts, Richard Greiner, and Floyd Tooke). Clark said this seating order was accidental, but nobody believed him. The two-hour discussion was argumentative, unrevealing, and inconclusive. Audience \"questions\" were mostly speeches defending pro or anti ideologies. The only agreement that emerged was that people who report hearing cable and amp differences should become part of a controlled testing program to find out what they are hearing.\n\nOne interesting point emerged from the panel discussion: Monster doesn't design cables, it's just a marketing company. Monster hires outside consultants like Bruce Brisson to design cables. Noel Lee listens to prototype designs and makes decisions partly by subjective listening. Apparently he is one of those people acutely sensitive to cable differences. When he hears a design that he likes, Monster forms out the production to a wire-manufacturing company. So it's not surprising that Monster has never tried to document any scientific basis for its performance claims: the company has no engineering staff or measuring labs. Noel Lee knows of no measurement that correlates with the difference that he hears; he referred questions on that subject to a consultant, a young Ontario civilian who claimed that audible differences among cables are due to measured differences in time dispersion on the order of 0.1 microseconds. Brisson's ads for his MIT cables make the same claim, but that time-scale corresponds to frequencies around 10 MHz, not to audio. Monster's current marketing campaign for microphone cable is based on testimonials from recognized engineers who have tried the cable and liked it.\n\n**Jack Mullin Historical Edition**\n\nEntering Century at the end of World War II, Sgt.

He returned inside and she noticed that his teeth were very long, sharp, and shone like gold. Rosamada was quite surprised; she had not noticed that his teeth were like this before. Her husband then took off his coat and then she saw that he had a two-pointed tail. She started to tremble with horror. What was happening? She had married a very handsome young man, who was this person?\n\nHer husband very abruptly took off his hat and the new wife almost fainted. The man had two horns and two very big and pointed ears.

Espinosa found three versions of the *El Medio Polillo* story that were being told in Puerto Rico in the beginning of this century. These versions were European and probably were brought to the island from Castile. R. S. Boggs in his article \"The Halfchick Tale in Spain and France\" summarizes the story as it was basically being told in Puerto Rico, but also found a literary version that was being used in schools in the United States. The story is retold in *The Green Fairy Book* by Andrew Lang from French Caballero. The version that I have translated seems to be closer to this version than to the original Castilian story. Apparently this version was introduced in Puerto Rico after the island became a possession of the United States in 1898. Marigloria Palma in her book *Muestras del Folklore Puertorriqueño* (in Spanish) tells the story as she heard it as a child. I have translated her version of the story and illustrated the story as I see it.\n\n**Summary**\n\nHalf-a-chick decides to travel to the capital to find a doctor to repair or add his missing half.

Such warfare is usually sporadic and short-lived since bands do not have formal leadership structures or enough warriors to sustain conflict for long. Most of the conflict arises from interpersonal arguments. Among the Tiv of Australia, for example, failure of one band to reciprocate another band’s wife-rigging with one of its own female relative led to abduction of women by the aggrieved band, precipitating a “war” that involved some spear-throwing (many did not shoot straight and even some of the onlookers were wounded) but mostly violent talk and verbal abuse.\\textsuperscript{15} For the Dobe ‘Kung, Lee found 22 cases of homicide by males and other periodic episodes of violence, mostly in disputes over water—not quite the gentle souls Elizabeth Marshall Thomas depicted in her *Harmless People* (1959).\\textsuperscript{16}\n\n**TRIBAL POLITICAL ORGANIZATION**\n\nWhereas bands involve small populations without structure, tribal societies involve at least two well-defined groups linked together in some way and range in population from about 100 to as many as 5,000 people. Though their social institutions can be fairly complex, there are no centralized political structures or offices in the strict sense of those terms. There may be headmen, but there are no rules of succession and sons do not necessarily succeed their fathers as is the case with chiefdoms. Tribal leadership roles are open to anyone—in practice, usually men, especially elder men who acquire leadership positions because of their personal abilities and qualities. Leaders in tribes do not have a means of coercing others or formal powers associated with their positions. Instead, they must persuade others to take actions they feel are needed. A Yanomami headman, for instance, said that he would never issue an order unless he knew it would be obeyed. The headman Kasbawá exercised influence by example and by making suggestions and warning of consequences of taking or not taking an action.\\textsuperscript{17}\n\nLike bands, tribes are egalitarian societies. Some individuals in a tribe do sometimes accumulate personal property but not to the extent that other tribe members are deprived. And every (almost always male) person has the opportunity to become a headman or leader and, like bands, one’s leadership position can be situational. One man may be a good mediator, another an exemplary warrior, and a third capable of leading a hunt or finding a more ideal area for cultivation or grazing herds. An example illustrating this kind of leadership is the **big man** of New Guinea; the term is derived from the languages of New Guinean tribes (literally meaning “man of influence”). The big man is one who has acquired followers by doing favors they cannot possibly repay, such as settling their debts or providing bride-wealth. He might also acquire as many wives as possible to create alliances with his wives’ families. His wives could work to care for as many pigs as possible, for example, and in due course, he could sponsor a pig feast that would serve to put more tribe members in his debt and shame his rivals. It is worth noting that the followers, incapable of repaying the Big Man’s gifts, stand metaphorically as beggars to him.\\textsuperscript{18}\n\nStill, a big man does not have the power of a monarch. His role is not hereditary. His son must demonstrate his worth and acquire his own following—he must become a big man in his own right."}

At this points it’s important to realize the limitations of our analogy. In a real LT coding scheme, the bag of fragments would be bottomless, so that we could always reach in and grab a new fistful of fragments, each different from the previous ones, and each containing new pieces of the vase that would be useful in reconstructing it. At this point, the reader might be thinking that this process sounds pretty wasteful, since it would end up getting lots of duplicate fragments. Indeed, it’s hard to see how this wouldn’t lead to a lot of overhead in the protocol.\n\nObviously there needs to be some degree of redundancy/overhead in any robust system like this, but we should distinguish between redundant data and wasteful overhead. By wasteful overhead, we mean that some of the bits we are sending are not the actual data itself, but rather the protocol that describes the fragments and how to assemble them. While such information is needed to make the system work, we want to keep it to an absolute minimum. After all, if we had to download all megabytes worth of 3 non-gadgetic chunks in order to reliably assemble a 5 megabyte file, that would be a pretty bad outcome, since the system would only be 5/30 = 16.6% efficient. This leads to the second surprising property of LT codes: in practice, they can achieve efficiency rates of upwards of 85%, as shown in the following figure, which shows that in order to download 2,048 “symbols” worth of data with a high probability of success, we generally will only need to download 2,300 symbols worth of LT chunks. As we continue to download more chunks, the probability of successfully decoding the entire file approaches 100%.\n\nThis means that the vast majority of our bandwidth is being put towards useful work: transferring the bits of data we want, not useless overhead that uses up our bandwidth without getting us closer to what we want—reconstructing the file. And yet, we still get these almost miraculous benefits: we can get file chunks from multiple sources, in any order, and every chunk is just as good/useful as any other chunk. No more stuck downloads, no more “rare” file chunks that we hope someone will make available—just data droplets, like water from a fountain, that we can slurp up from anywhere until our glass is full and we have the file! But how will we know that we have the right file? That part is easy: we store the SHA-256 hash of the original image file in the art registration ticket on the blockchain, and we keep getting new LT chunks until the reconstructed file hashes to this exact same value.\n\nLT Codes were originally designed for a broadcaster-subscriber model, in which the broadcaster (for example, the NFL streaming a live game, or Steam serving a video game demo to users) has a full copy of the file/stream, and generates new LT chunks on the fly in an “endless stream” of chunks, and"}

More problematic has been the mapping of mathematically defined emergence onto scientific phenomena. Bateson’s difference-based epistemology can be simulated by a Boolean network model. Bateson proposed that taking differences in differences would produce emergent hierarchies of knowledge. Simulating the proposal in Boolean model, by taking differences in differences, generates hierarchical categories of perceptual stimuli. The crucial result is that these model-generated categories correspond to human perceptual categorical judgments. Thus the model-defined emergence hierarchy maps to perceptual hierarchies. Three realms of description will converge on the concept of emergence: Batesonian epistemology, a Boolean model, and human perceptual experience. In this case at least, this convergence grounds model-defined emergence both to a broad epistemological framework and to human experience.\n\n**Resemblance in Morphogenesis**\nThomas Malloy, Psychology, University of Utah\n\nThe resemblance of one form to another is a phenomenon of basic interest in perception. In a Boolean net model attractor cycles are coded as a sequence of state vectors (of 0 and 1 s) easily expressible as visual forms. This expression corresponds to the idea of morphogenesis. Let the forms resulting from two attractor cycles be Parent 1 and Parent 2. Take two state vectors, one from each parent, and create a Child vector by splicing together half the 0 s and 1 s from one parent and half the 0 s and 1 s from the other to create a new state vector, analogous to gene splicing. Run the system starting from the new state vector. Under very broad constraints, the system will fall into a third, third, attractor cycle, which expressed as a visual form will resemble both Parent 1 and Parent 2 while having its own unique form.\n\n**The Myth of Psyche Through Nonlinear Eye**\nTerry Marks-Tarlow, Clinical Psychologist, Private Practice, CA, Training Faculty, Southern California Counseling Center\n\nAn aspect of nonlinear science in context is how new ideas fit into old systems. One context vital to the pursuit of meaning in psychology is ancient mythology. With historical precedents set by Freud, Jung, May, and Hilman, clinical practice is frequently guided by originating myths that supply root metaphors and narratives. This paper analyzes the myth of Psyche, derivatized of our field’s name psychology and its subject matter: the psyche. Nonlinear wisdom emerges through several important themes: the necessity of living in the dark with chaos; the self-organizing quality of nature, both inner and outer; interpenetrating, fractal boundaries between self, world, and other; and the paradoxical essence of psyche, where only through separation and individuation can we open ourselves to love and vital interconnection with others.\n\n**Controlling Duopoly Chaos**\nAkio Matsumoto, Electronics, Chuo University\n\nThe recently developing theory of nonlinear dynamics reveals that any economic model can generate complex dynamics involving chaos if its nonlinearities become strong enough. The main purpose of this study is to consider economic implications of generating chaos as well as controlling chaos in a Cournot duopoly model with unimodal reaction functions. An evoked characteristic of economic chaos is demonstrated. From the long-run point of view, one of the duopolists can be beneficial, and the other harmful in the chaotic market in a sense that the long-run average profit taken along chaotic trajectories is larger than the one of the latter. Then this study applies two distinctive control methods, the adaptive control method and the pole-plateon method to the chaotic markets, in order to show that putting controls reverse the situation: the beneficial duopolist in the chaotic market becomes disadvantageous and the harmful duopolist advantageous in the controlled market. This implies that either way of generating chaos or controlling chaos is unable to make both duopolists happy together.\n\n**STCPSL 2005**"}

To determine the floor price, we need to select a safety margin (15 percent) and make our best guess at what the average sale price for the year will be (CFAF 800). The latter would normally be calculated by combining receipts already locked in through forward sales (1/3 at CFAF 820) with the expected price of future sales (CFAF 790). The former is known by the monopolist, but would have to be estimated by a committee if they were several private cotton companies. If the committee overestimated the share sold forward, the safety margin would be reduced.\\(^{51}\\)\n\nTo determine the second payment, we only need to know the difference between the forecast (CFAF 790) and the actual value of Index A. Cotton companies would be free to sell when they want and how they want, spot or forward; the company selling better or producing more efficiently would make more profit in a level playing field, which is what we want.\n\nIf growers believed that the system would be applied fairly, they might find it acceptable. A second payment in early June would come at an opportune time because, a few months before the new crops mature, farmers are short of cash and a number apply for *credits de souture*. But the case illustrated on Table 7 was an easy one because, when the floor price was selected, the best bet was that receipts and costs would remain in balance; the floor price was only an insurance against random price falls.\n\nWhen prices are expected to fall, the problem becomes more difficult. Thus if, at the eve of sowing, the best bet had been a 15 percent (or 30 percent) drop in Index A, adding up a 15 percent insurance premium would have reduced the floor price to CFAF 162 (or 146). Net return to growers, which is what really matters since it is with growers actually get, would have fallen by 29 percent (or 42 percent). Reducing the floor price too sharply creates political and economic risks (such as Mali’s cotton boycott in 2000/01) which the society may not willing to bear.\\(^{52}\\) Mali is a case in point. By mid-May 2002, when the floor price of CFAF 180 was announced, the loss was estimated at CFAF 41 per kg of seed cotton for the 2001/02 crop and foreseen as CFAF 38 per kg of seed cotton for the 2002/03 crop. It is clear that the CFAF 180 price did not incorporate any safety margin; it anticipated a subsidy.\\(^{53}\\)\n\n### 6.2 Who should bear the price risk?\n\nThe price risk is large for two reasons. First, a 3 cents decline in Index A (from 41 to 38) combined with a 3 cent increase in the value of the euro (from US cents 92 to 95) would result in a 10 percent fall in CFAF export prices and, everything else remaining the same, it would raise Mali’s deficit by CFAF 15 billion and Benin’s deficit by CFAF 11 billion. Second, our forecasting ability is limited, as shown by the experience of ICAC which issues widely used bimonthly forecasts starting two years before the end of the forecast year. The analysis of these forecasts over the last 13\n\n---\n\n\\(^{51}\\) If it were believed that one third was sold forward while nothing had been sold, the safety margin would be reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent.\n\n\\(^{52}\\) Numerous proposals have been made for setting producer prices. According to one proposal, three different prices should be set. The first would be a social price providing a minimum remuneration to growers for their labor; this price, which would define the absolute minimum, could remain unchanged for a few years. The second would be an indicative price announced at sowing time and the third would be the actual price announced at the beginning of the marketing season. Since none of these prices could be set on strictly objective grounds, their determination would lead to a series of lengthy negotiations. We would therefore favor the single floor price with two-step payments outlined above.\n\n\\(^{53}\\) One cannot be surprised that governments had an impact on the determination of the floor price in several of the countries reviewed. Australia may be the only important country where government obtains from any intervention in the pricing of seed cotton. But, cotton is grown in 1,300 very large farms producing an average of some 1,200 tons of seed cotton each."}

For example, both of the expansion hypotheses rest on differential cell production, either in the radial domain (i.e., laminar differences) or the tangential domain (i.e., cortical column number). Both, therefore, suggest that isolated programs of neurogenesis along the protomap-specified areas yield the resulting pattern of cortical folding most appreciated after birth. Incidentally, while the axonal tension hypothesis primarily focuses on forces generated by differentiated neurons, it also invokes the area-specific projection and targeting patterns that must be conferred to the neocortical layers upon their generation from the underlying precursor cells. Thus, all theories for gyrification require a significant role for precursor cells in establishing the regions that will eventually undergo convolution.\n\nRecent studies have provided a role for precursor gene expression and its consequences on neurogenesis as a predictor of gyrification. In particular, a key study identified the cell-adhesion molecules FLRT1 and FLRT3 in regulating area-specific formation of gyri and sulci (Del Toro et al. 2017). These two genes are upregulated in the lissencephalo mouse neocortical wall and downregulated in the gyrencephalic ferret and human neocortical wall in regions of incipient gyrus formation. This study shows that perturbation to lower the levels of FLRT1/3 expression lead to faster neuronal migration rates and to clusters of neurons expressing a similar level of these adhesion molecules. The increased radial and tangential pressure caused by these clustered neurons is postulated to lead to localized formation of a gyrus, even in the normally smooth mouse neocortex. Another gene recently identified in the germinal zones that plays a role in neocortical folding is Trnp1, which encodes a nuclear protein potentially involved in chromatin state (Stahl et al. 2013). Knockdown of Trnp1 alters the pattern of cell division in the VZ, causing overproduction of bIPSCs and bRGCs. The hypothesis of this study is that increases in the numbers of resulting neurons, and their tangential spread afforded by the increased number of bRGC fibers, result in gyrus formation in the overlying neocortical sheet. A study by de Juan Romero et al. (2015) offers perhaps the most convincing argument for a link between differential gene regulation in the germinal zones, expansion of bRGCs, and formation of overlying cortical convolutions. In this study, regions of the ferret neocortical wall, which later develop either a gyrus or a sulcus, were isolated at a stage in early development prior to the formation of these folds. Upon microarray profiling, many hundreds of genes were differentially expressed between these two areas, and clear expression of these genes in the oSWZ in the future gyrus site was contrasted to the lack of their expression in the oSVZ of the neighboring future sulcus site. In addition, a human RGC-specific gene, ARGAP1IB, was shown to increase basal precursor proliferation and cortical folding when introduced into the developing mouse germinal zones (Florio et al. 2015).\n\nFrom “The Neocortex,” edited by W.

The representative of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic submitted a draft resolution [C/CN.4/L.63/3], which read as follows:\n\n\"The Commission on Human Rights.\n\n\"Recalling that one of the purposes of the United Nations expressed in the Charter is to promote and encourage respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion;\n\n\"Mindful of the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in securing universal and effective recognition and observance of fundamental human rights and freedoms;\n\n\"Considering that the Declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples states that the subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights, is contrary to the United Nations Charter and is an impediment to the promotion of world peace and co-operation;\n\n\"Mindful also of other decisions of the United Nations concerning fundamental human rights and freedoms,\n\n\"1. Decides to include in the provisional for its nineteenth session an item entitled 'Measures to be taken for the speediest implementation of United Nations decisions concerning fundamental human rights and freedoms';\n\n2. Requests the Acting Secretary-General to prepare a survey of United Nations decisions concerning fundamental human rights and freedoms;\n\n30.2. In presenting the draft resolution, the representative of the Ukrainian SSR stated that the United Nations had adopted a number of very important declarations and resolutions on human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples and the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. However, he pointed out, the situation remained unsatisfactory in parts of the world, both in the field of civil and political rights and in the field of economic, social and cultural rights. The time had come for the United Nations to make a survey of all its decisions concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take measures for the speediest implementation of those decisions. A complete survey of the United Nations decisions would enable the Commission to examine the human rights situation as a whole and to consider and recommend appropriate and effective measures, within the framework of the United Nations Charter, which would enable all peoples and nations to enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\n30.3. The draft resolution was put to the vote; it was rejected, the vote being, in favour, 8 against, with 4 abstentions. After the vote some representatives regretted that the failure of the Commission to adopt the resolution which, according to their view, would have constituted a significant development in the Commission's programme of work.\n\nDRAFT PRINCIPLES ON FREEDOM AND NON-DISCRIMINATION IN THE MATTER OF RELIGIOUS RIGHTS AND PRACTICES\n\n30.4. The representative of the Philippines submitted a draft resolution [C/CN.4/L.61/2], which read as follows:\n\n\"The Commission on Human Rights.\n\n\"Considering that the draft principles on freedom and non-discrimination in the matter of religious rights and practices were submitted to it in 1960 by the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities;\n\n\"Considering further that the Commission has been unable to complete the examination of the draft principles at its eighteenth session;\n\n\"Considering finally that it is desirable to have sufficient time as its next session to complete the examination of the draft principles as well as other items on its agenda,\n\n\"1. Decides to continue consideration of the draft principles at its nineteenth session; and\n\n2.

Only a proportion of the load is free to slosh at any one time and so the effect is reduced. It has been shown (UMTRI, 2001) that if no more than 20% of the total load is free to slosh at any one time the rollover stability of the partially loaded vehicle will always be greater than that of a fully loaded vehicle.\n\nCurrent New Zealand regulations for hazardous goods transport require compartments of less than 10,000 litres if fitted with baffles (these are transverse baffles) or less than 7,000 litres if not fitted with baffles. In practice this means that typical petrol tanker semi-trailers have more than five compartments and thus, provided they are unloaded correctly, will always have better rollover stability when partially laden than when fully laden. This is not necessarily the case for tankers not carrying hazardous goods. To facilitate cleaning, milk tankers are generally not compartmentalised. They are usually fitted with baffles but only in the transverse direction. In their favour most of their travel distance is done with the tank either empty or fully laden.\n\n**Hanging Meat Loads**\n\nIn hanging meat loads, the meat is suspended by hooks on rails suspended from the ceiling or walls of a refrigerated van body. In New Zealand there are two basic types of vehicle configuration used for transporting hanging meat. The first of these is a dedicated vehicle in which case the rails run longitudinally along the length of the vehicle with, typically, five rails across the width of the vehicle. These vehicles are typically a little over 2m from floor to ceiling because the driver has to be able to reach the rails to take carcasses on and off. Two of the vehicles used in inspected were of this type (see Figure 4 and Figure 5). In both these cases the floor-to-ceiling height was 2.1m. The alternative is a generally-purpose vehicle in which case removable cross-beams are fitted with slots that act as transverse rails. A single longitudinal rail is used as a feeder to the transverse rails. The third load we inspected was of this type as shown in Figure 6. The feeder rail runs along the left hand side of the vehicle. General-purpose vehicles typically have a greater internal height to allow for other high volume loads but the hanging meat rails are hung at a height where the driver can reach them and so there is relatively little difference in payload height between these vehicles when carrying a hanging meat load. In the particular example shown in Figure 6 the transverse beams are 2.25m above the floor.\n\nBroadly speaking, the transport of hanging meat can be categorised as involving one of two freight tasks; the load haul task where meat is moved from a meat processing facility to a cool store or distribution centre and the local delivery task where meat is moved from a distribution centre to retail outlets such as supermarkets or butchers’ shops. The line haul task generally involves full vehicles loads of a single species while local delivery vehicles may carry a mix of species and may make multiple stops so that, at least some of the time, they are only partially loaded. In practice this distinction is not so clear cut. Line haul loads may involve multiple drop-off points so that significant parts of the journey are done with part-loads. Local delivery operations are not limited to urban driving and may involve open-road speeds with high-speed cornering so rollover stability is important for these loads as well. Figure 4 shows a line haul load of pig carcasses which was transported from the South Island to Auckland. In the case parts of the load were delivered to several North Island centre en-route so that the load as photographed is only a part-load. Figure 5 shows a typical local delivery hanging meat load showing the less tight packing and the mixture of species, while Figure 6 is also a line haul part load."}

URECOSCI might feel that it could fulfill the functions of a CSPR.\n\nBurkina Faso will not need a CSPR before the two new zones are managed independently. It would not need one either in the transition period, if SOFITEX and the two new zones were given exclusive purchasing rights during that period.\n\nInput supply had already been partly liberalized for some time. This has been the case for herbicides in Côte d’Ivoire since 1988. Herbicides were bought on credit by unions which were selling them to cooperatives which, in turn, were selling them to growers, but the scheme was not very successful. On one hand, growers complained of being overcharged because of commissions collected at each step of the distribution chain. On the other hand, suppliers complained of payment arrears (close to CFAF 6 billion). Arrears represent a cost for suppliers who have to recover it in some way; ultimately, cotton producers have to pay for them. In Burkina Faso, cereal inputs and herbicides were recently purchased through cooperatives, but it was a small-scale experiment which ended with credit recovery problems.\n\n4.3 The input problem in non-CFA countries\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the input credit scheme was launched shortly before privatization, and it was expanded by Copros and Cotoa after privatization. This scheme became increasingly relevant with the replacement of commercial by small-scale farmers. Poaching recently became a problem in Zimbabwe, and it has been a major problem in Ghana and Tanzania. Poaching was largely due to the presence of small traders with no significant investment in the sector and no interest in the future of the sector. CFA countries may, therefore, take appropriate measures to prevent such traders from entry when they liberalize their cotton sector.\n\nThe Farmer Input Voucher system recently launched by Cargill in Zimbabwe does not provide any credit, since the cost of inputs for crop t+1 is deducted from the payment for crop t. But the simplicity of the scheme is attractive. It is attractive for the company which sells its goods when the buyer feels rich because he is being paid; moreover, the buyer of fertilizer today may become the seller of seed cotton in the next crop year, which will help the company in expanding its turnover. The deal may also be attractive to the grower, since he can load his inputs on the truck he used to bring his seed cotton and can return home feeling secure about his next crop.\n\n4.4 Credit repayment may be hampered by drought and disease\n\nBecause small-scale farmers in Zimbabwe do not have the resources to irrigate their fields, their yields are lower than those of commercial farmers and their yields are more dependent on rainfall levels. For an average of 800 kg per ha in the last 30 years, the average yield of small-scale farmers fell to 158 kg in 1991/92, 335 kg in 1994/95 and a projected 524 kg in 2001/02. With an input cost equivalent to some 250 kg of seed cotton, it is clear that many farmers will not be able to repay input credits in 2001/02. Cotto will have to reschedule a number of its loans, which will increase its risk exposure.\n\n---\n\n30 Over the last 32 years, yields of small-scale farmers were correlated with the level of rainfalls in December, January and February (Rq 0.43); a 10 percent increase in rainfalls during these three months led to a 7 percent increase in yields. The correlation was much weaker for commercial farmers (Rq = 0.04), because the latter irrigated their fields whenever needed. Yields for small and large scale farms are shown for the last 8 years in Annex Table 2."}

About 37,400 (29%) of these jobs are found in the C-3 District (Table 7). This is roughly the same share of retail jobs reported in 2014.\n\nHotel Employment\n\nSan Francisco's hotel jobs are heavily concentrated downtown. As of the second quarter of 2015, there were approximately 16,700 hotel jobs in the city. About 10,660 (64%) of these jobs were in the C-3 District.\n\nRevenue\n\nThis section reports tax revenues from business taxes (including registration and payroll), property taxes (including transfer tax and annual rate), sales and use taxes, and the hotel tax for the 2015-2016 fiscal year (FY). The information reported for FY15-16 are revenue projections for the full fiscal year, and are based on the amount collected as of March 31, 2016. In general, the FY 2015-16 budget assumed increases in tax revenue thanks to continued economic growth.4\n\nBusiness Taxes\n\nBusiness tax revenue (Table 8) in FY 2015-16 is estimated at $654.7 million, up 6% from $616 million in FY 2014-15. In November 2012, San Francisco voters approved the Gross Receipts Tax and Business Registration Fee Ordinance (Proposition 63), which introduced major changes to the way businesses are taxed in the city. On January 1, 2014, the City started collecting a Gross Receipts tax, and phasing out the existing Payroll tax. In this fiscal year, total business tax revenue is comprised of business payroll tax, registration tax, gross receipts tax, and administrative office tax.\n\nBusiness payroll taxes assess the payroll expense of persons and associations engaging in business in San Francisco and continue to represent the vast majority of business taxes collected. This tax imposes a fee on all businesses that employ or contract with one or more employees to perform work or render services within the city. In FY 2015-16, the Controller's Office estimated that it will collect $464.2 million in payroll taxes, down 8.3% from $506.4 million in FY 2014-15.\n\nBusiness registration tax is an annual fee assessed for general revenue purposes on all business in the city. The formula for calculating this fee was amended as part of Prop E, resulting in significantly higher collections starting in FY 13-14. The Controller's Office estimates that approximately $35.7 million in business registration fees will be collected in FY 2015-16, up 5.3% from $33.9 million in FY 2014-15.\n\nGross receipts and Administrative office taxes are based on a business's gross receipts from business done in San Francisco, rather than on a business's payroll expense. As the Gross Receipts Tax is phased in to replace the Payroll Tax, collections have grown significantly, to an estimated $133.1 million in FY 2015-16, a 141% increase over FY 14-15. The Controller's Office estimates that approximately $21.7 in administrative office taxes will be collected in FY 2015-16.\n\nProperty Taxes\n\nReal property taxes (Table 9) are the largest single source of tax revenue for the City. The Controller's Office expects property taxes to increase in fiscal year 2015-16.7 Together, an estimated $1.63 billion in property related taxes will be collected in FY 2015-16, up 2.7% from $1.59 billion last year.\n\nReal property taxes allocated to the general fund in FY 2015-16 are estimated at $1.37 billion, up 8% from $1.27 billion in FY 2014-15 (Table 9).\n\nProperty transfer taxes are estimated to decrease by 18.6% during the reporting period. Projected collections for FY 2015-16 are estimated to be about $256 million, down from $314.6 million in FY 2014-15. (Table 9). Unlike real property taxes, which are collected annually and based on property valuation assessments, property transfer tax is highly volatile because it is collected only at the time of sale and is based on sales price.\n\n4 Final War 2015 logins on July 1, 2015 and ends on June 30, 2016.\n\n5 City and County of San Francisco, Controller's Office, FY 2015-14 Non-Month Budget Report, May 15, 2016."}

In their proposals, prospective service providers are asked to describe how they will coordinate benefits with any other programs that serve the elderly or disabled, how they will coordinate activities with county long-term care programs, Medicare and ALTCS, and how the provider will ensure that these fund sources are maximized to use AAA funding only when no other source is available, in order to ensure coordination of services and integration of multiple funding sources. Cost Share is encouraged, and case managers, service providers, and AAA monitor these contributions.\n\nTitle VII Efforts: The SEAGO AAA will continue to host the Region VI Conference of Aging, where information on Long Term Care Ombudsman, SHIP, and SMP programs are featured. While it was not possible to host the conference during SYF21, our intention stands once we can do it safely from Covid, SEAGO will continue to hold workshops on Medicare, advanced directives, and selecting LTC policies, as well as scam jams across the region. Besides, case-managed services target those who lack a support system, low income, and those who are most vulnerable, including adult protective service referrals. Participation in community meetings, trainings, health and resource fairs, and other events will offer opportunities to get the word out about LTC Ombudsman, SHIP, SMP programs and services, and how to prevent, detect, and report abuse neglect, and financial exploitation of older adults. As new training modules are out at the state level, these modules will be adopted, and once completed, the LTCO will make an effort to recruit more volunteers in the area. The Long Term Care Ombudsman program and the State Health Insurance Program are collaborating in building an Elder Fraud and Abuse taskforce in Cochise county. We see that with the multiple changes happening since COVID, we must educate and inform our communities. We have organizations that work with the elderly as partners that will help the Area Agency on Aging address the needs of those affected or reduce the number of cases throughout our region.\n\nOther: SEAGO-AAA Management Analyst oversees the Case Management program, and since her partaking, we see even more impact in the program. She coordinates services and funding availability amongst the case managers and service providers to assist the director in projecting future spending. She provides training and guidance to our case managers on changes happening within the organization. The modification is preparing our Management Analysis for when SEAGO-AAA begins to bring the case management in-house.\n\nWith a grant obtained through the Legacy Foundation of Southeast Arizona and the David and Lura Lovell Foundation, the Area Agency on Aging has successfully adopted End of Life Care Matters since 2018. With the dedication and support from Veronica “Ronnie” Snyders, we are successfully going into our third year. Thus far, we have accomplished our goal to expand our services throughout the four-county region by hosting Thoughtful Life Conversations workshops. Our goal has been to normalize and increase conversations by providing several venues for discussing and planning for end-of-life issues and healthcare planning, including advance directives. We have developed our Workplace Initiative (WPI) to provide education to organizations that provide healthcare and social services to patients and clients. We have reached over 600 participants, over 40 workshops and partnered with 19 local organizations. There is representation from the Area Agency on Aging in the AZ Health Directive Registry committee for the transition. We commit ourselves to help make this transition a huge success."}

These trends must be studied within the trends observed for the Wadden Sea as a whole. For many bird species just feed on the intertidal flats of the Wadden Sea, a change in trend in the annual usage of the flats occurs somewhere at the end of the 1980s, beginning of the 1990s (Figure 47, Figure 48, Figure 49, Figure 50). This corresponds to the disappearance of the intertidal mussel beds. In the graphs we fitted a trend line using splines (Hastie & Tibshirani, 1990) for the entire period, and for the periods before and after the disappearance of the intertidal mussel beds. We subsequently tested whether the change in trend was statistically significant. Changes from a negative trend towards a positive trend outnumber changes from a positive trend towards a negative trend. For species feeding either primarily on worms or shellfish, the greater the percentage shellfish in the diet, the larger the decline during the last ten years (van Roomen et al., 2004). The only species not fitting the trend is the avocet, which feeds on worms, yet showed a decline in recent years. For species that feed primarily on prey other than bivalves or worms (Figure 50), and for species whose diet is a mixture of shellfish, worms and other prey (Figure 49), no simple patterns emerge.\n\nFour species of birds were identified as shellfish eaters: common eider, ostercatcher, herring gull and knot. All these species have declined in recent years, although the onset of the decline varies between the species (Figure 47). Of these, the common eider and the ostercatcher feed on large shellfish, whereas knot and herring gull feed on small shellfish. Since common eiders depend primarily on the subtidal areas for their food supply, we did not investigate the effect of closing intertidal areas. In contrast to waders, several counts of eiders covering the entire Wadden Sea are available for the period before 1975. We did not include these counts in (Figure 47) to facilitate comparison with the other bird species. However, including these counts makes clear that the suggestion that eiders have continually decreased from 1975 onwards is an artefact of this selection of the data. Eiders have increased during the 1960s, fluctuated in numbers during the 1970s and 1980s, and declined during the 1990s. The recent decline in the Wadden Sea was accompanied by an increase in the number of eiders using the North Sea coastal zone (see Figure 72 in chapter 5), but this increase did not fully compensate for the decline in the Wadden Sea (Ens & Kats, 2004). The interpretation of these changes is discussed in chapter 5, where the policy of food reservation for common eiders is evaluated.\n\nThe numbers of ostercatchers declined after about 1990 (Figure 47). The decline in the number of ostercatchers started in the first half of the 1990s. Since the strong and sudden decline due to the severe winter of 1996/1997, no further decline has occurred, nor have numbers recovered. The lowest numbers are largely due to the disappearance of the intertidal mussel beds in 1990 (Smit et al., 1998; Rappoldt et al., 2003a), see also chapter 5. The fact that we did not see a sudden decline in the number of ostercatchers following the rather sudden disappearance of the intertidal"}

About a month before, the Fondazione Matera-Basilicata 2019 was established, with the aim of managing, monitoring and evaluating the entire process.\n\nThe application file, drawn up by the Matera 2019 Committee, is based on five thematic strands, which find their raison d’être in the relationship with the past: Remote Future, Continuity and Ruptures, Utopias and Dystopias, Roots and Paths, Reflections and Connections. The five themes are the common thread along which the entire file is developed, as well as most of the initiatives financed and carried out by the Foundation during the year 2019. The “functional manipulation of memory”, and its staging, has played a decisive role and has certainly influenced the rhetoric of representation and communication linked to the city and its relationship with the past, especially with reference to the past-future dichotomy. The, then mayor of the city, Salvatore Adduce, wrote in the first pages of the file:\n\n“The unique experience of a community which, in the immediate post-war period, was able to face the terrible question of the uninhabitable nature of its beautiful city, allows us to tell the whole world that from a great emergency, such as that of the emptying of the Sassi, it is possible to ensure, through intelligent planning, new hospitality to an entire population. [...] The new challenge consists in proposing to the citizens to “regenerate” the city together, overcoming the distrust and fatalism that often characterize our territories. Matera and Basilicata want to announce to Europe that another South is possible, putting behind them the stereotypes of a Southern Italy bent on itself and in perennial waiting for assistance.”\n\nThe objective, therefore, clearly stated by the two files, is to contribute to creating, on the part of the Matera community, but also on the part of the institutional powers, a new collective conscience, which reappearates its own memory and makes it a source of pride. The tourism factor favours, and in some cases accelerates, this process of re-appropriation.\n\nWithout going into the merits of what was, or could have been, such an opportunity, let us try to examine some examples of how the functional use of “memory” has contributed in many cases to overturning the hitherto stereotyped vision of a timeless reality, a symbol of archaism and backwardness as a reason for pride, contributing to defining, through the elaboration, construction, attribution and use of elements linked to the past and tradition, what Eugenio Imbriani, the Italian"}

The lower gross margin for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 of 32.1% (versus 60.4% for the prior fiscal year) was a result of lower volume. The Company, which is largely leveraged on volume, made investments in its infrastructure during the first half of calendar year 2010 in order to provide for the capacity to take on large increases in volume. As a result, the combination of lower volume and greater capacity creates negative leverage and adversely impacts gross margin.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the year ended June 30, 2011 of $9.8 million, increased by $1.0 million, from SG&A expenses of $8.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2010. The increase in SG&A expense is primarily due to higher (i) professional expenses of $0.4 million (primarily due to regulatory and consulting related fees, legal fees, audit and related fees, and other sales-related consulting fees), (ii) compensation and benefit expense including payroll tax of $0.2 million (primarily due to timing of employee hires and terminations), (iii) costs associated with a legal settlement of $0.35 million and (iv) severance costs of $0.05 million.\n\nRegarding costs associated with a legal settlement included in SG&A expense, the Company settled a suit in which the plaintiff alleged violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Although the Company believes it did not violate any laws, the Company settled the lawsuit in the interest of avoiding additional legal costs and diverting time and focus from growing the business.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company recorded a special charge of $0.6 million on a pre-tax basis, or $0.02 per diluted loss per share, which represents expenses incurred with the retirement of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Burton Kunkl. The special charge consists of (i) severance-related items totaling $0.5 million, (ii) non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.1 million (resulting from accelerated vesting of stock option awards), and (iii) legal fees related to the separation agreement of less than $0.1 million.

The operating margin was (23.4%) for the year ended June 30, 2011 compared to 36.8% for the year ended June 30, 2010. The decrease in operating income and operating margin is a result of the above mentioned decrease in revenue and operating leverage inherent in the Company’s business model.\n\nThe Company generated a loss before income taxes of $4.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 versus income before income taxes of $14.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2010. The decrease in income before income taxes is a result of lower operating income (discussed above).\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2011 was 33.8% compared to 35.2% for the year ended June 30, 2010. The Company uses estimates in providing for income taxes on a year to date basis and those estimates may change in subsequent interim periods.\n\nThe Company generated a net loss of $3.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 compared to net income of $9.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2010.

It is, in fact, an ancient concept. However, it was time to begin reviving mutuality and interdependence in our societies, and it was Judith who was the spark, the catalyst, and thus, the connector for so many of us.\n\nAsking the Great Questions\n\nJudith once said, “A great question refuses to be answered; so it keeps leading us into deeper connections with each other and into deeper thinking.” As Judith’s life depended on the asking of great questions, she became a master of questioning. In so doing, she made it possible for others to pursue great questions, taking them to places they did not even know existed. As a philosopher, as a scientist, as a researcher, as an engineer, as a guru, and ultimately as an artist, Judith learned and in turn taught us to pursue the question of “How do I make the invisible, visible?” The implicit and explicit questions she stewarded led engineers to discover how a woman with only movement in one thumb could control a 300 lb motorized wheelchair; and when her thumb no longer worked, how her breath could; how burly bouncers in upstairs nightclubs could make a building accessible; how adventurers could make canoeing and rock climbing possible; and how artists, engineers, and programmers could make it possible for her to paint and sculpt. But mostly, Judith’s mastery of the great question magically drew people to join in the quest; all were welcomed and ultimately the community that emerged and seek a bigger question, calling us all to go deeper.\n\nAsset-Based Community Development and Mobility\n\nAlthough Judith was deeply engaged in issues around disability, her interests and commitments were so much broader. Judith fulfilled a dream that she had for many years: to be rooted in her local community, with all the diversity, joys, challenges, and problems that are integral to all communities. As a neighbor and active leader in community development projects with her friends and neighbors, and in the local community health center (LAMP) as an executive member of the Board, Judith was a great neighbor and a respected agent for change by those who knew her in the Lakeshore community.\n\nJudith was a founding member of the Marsha Forest Centre, and while the Center supported Judith, she supported families and the development of Circles with the Center for 25 years. She joined the faculty of the ABCD Institute with John McKnight, and was a key thinker and professor at with that remarkable team of 52. She took community development into politics and challenged the nature of our democracy by being a member of the communist party, running as a candidate in three Canadian elections. She was a live exhibit at the Royal Ontario Museum for an extended showing of 9 months. It was an art exhibit, with Judith as a living part of the exhibit, shocking unsuspecting patrons and staff into a deeper understanding of possibility. She was key to a team of gamers who are still working on a computerized “Zombie” game where, to survive, you must help the Zombies to be included: a game of inclusion, now that is a Judith twist.\n\nRespectful Interdependence\n\nThe first time one met Judith they might have been struck with the thought that she was the epitome of independent living. Those of us who were fortunate enough to come to know Judith more intimately quickly learned that her life was lived in respectful interdependence. Judith depended on friends and allies to help her carry her message, which became our message.\n\nEarly on, Judith showed people what an independent minded woman who used a wheelchair could do. Later on in her career and life, Judith showed us what respectful interdependence could look like in so many different ways. As Judith spoke about the idea of gifts and giftedness, she was calling forward the idea of interdependence rather than independence."}

Older counts, which are available from 1978 onwards, have been analyzed as part of EVA II, after correcting for missing counts through imputing (Rappold et al., 2003b). Compared to the Delta area, the frequency of counts in the Wadden Sea covering the entire area has been decidedly lower, on average three times a year (Meltofte et al., 1994; van Roomen et al., 2003).\n\nThe longest uninterrupted counting series for the Wadden Sea (from 1973/1974 onwards) is available for the month of January. A logical choice is therefore to restrict analyses of bird numbers to this month (Leopold et al., 2003b; Verhulst et al., 2004). However, January counts have a problem due to ice winters. When the mud flats become covered with ice during a sufficiently long period of frost, a large number of ostercatchers may leave the Wadden Sea to winter elsewhere (Hulscher, 1989; Hulscher et al., 1996; Camphuysen et al., 1996). During the past century, such hard-weather movements from the Dutch Wadden Sea have occurred in at least 10 of 92 years (Hulscher et al., 1996). Very low counts of ostercatchers in the winters of 1986/87 and 1996/97 are due to hard-weather movement and not to a change in the number of ostercatchers that arrived in autumn to spend the winter in the area. One solution is to include integral counts for other months in the imputing exercise. To the 29 integral counts for January, 33 counts during other months in the period August-December can be included (Leopold et al., 2003b). This provides only a partial solution. For the winter of 1996/97 there were additional counts in August and December, so the new estimate is clearly higher. However, for the winter of 1986/87 only the January count is available, so the procedure makes no difference.\n\nApart from integral counts of the whole Dutch Wadden Sea, there are many sites throughout the Wadden Sea that are counted on a much more regular basis. These counts can also be included in the imputing to yield an estimate of the number of ostercatchers in each site in each month. For the studies of Leopold et al. (2003b) and Rappoldt et al. (2003a) counting data of individual counting sites were first clustered into larger areas and then imputing was done for these larger cluster areas. More recently, SOYON has performed imputing directly on the individual counting sites, without first clustering these sites into larger areas (van Roomen & van Winden, pers. comm.). Including the counts of sites counted more regularly leads to estimated numbers that vary smoothly over the years. Such gradual changes in numbers are what one would expect for a long-lived species like the ostercatcher. We therefore conclude that imputing using all counts offers the best estimate of the number of ostercatchers deciding to spend the winter in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The precise estimate of the total number depends on the details of the imputing and this requires further study.\n\nA distinction was made between areas open for fishing, areas closed for shellfish fishing and areas that could not be classified (Figure 7). Since bird counts take place during high tide, the assignment to the low tide feeding areas had to be based on expert judgement and is open to further improvement. Especially for species that travel long distances to reach the feeding grounds, errors are likely."}

The Company faces strong competition from other companies in the industry. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities than Prodigy. As a result of this competition, the Company may be unable to maintain its operations or develop them as currently proposed, on terms it considers acceptable or at all.

Whether or not we will observe the predicted positive correlation between return rate and amount of food per bird depends on the time scale over which the local population becomes adjusted to a lowered or increased food supply. If the population becomes adjusted within a single winter, we will not observe a significant correlation between return rate and food supply. In that case, the return rate will not depend on the mismatch between the number of birds and the food supply in the current year, but on the difference between the food stock in the current year and the next year. If, on the other hand, adjustment takes many years, as seems to be the case for the ostercherates in the Dutch Wadden Sea, we may not observe a correlation either. The slow response of the ostercherates in the Dutch Wadden Sea may be explained by the fact that they comprise more than half of the continental European population (Gross-Custard et al., 1996a). Thus, changes in the Wadden Sea population will be largely determined by naturally and mortality, instead of immigration and emigration. Both natural and mortality are low in the long-lived ostercherate, so adjustment will be slow, except when extreme events cause high mortality. Thus, the absence of a significant correlation cannot be taken as evidence that the population does not respond to changes in the size of the food stock.\n\nUncertainty in the estimates of the population size, related to imputing, poses an additional problem. The estimated trend in the total number of wintering ostercherates is quite robust to the precise details of imputing. However, return rate depends on the difference in numbers between two consecutive years. Since ostercherates population numbers generally change slowly over the years, this difference is generally small. As a result, small differences in the estimated total number of ostercherates, which do not matter for the overall trend, can have a big effect on the estimated return rate. According to recent insights it is better to impute missing data on the basis of individual counting sites and not first clustering these counting sites into larger units (Soldaat et al., 2004). Preliminary calculations indicate that return rate is quite sensitive to the method of imputing and that the new method adopted by SOVON leads to poorer correlations for the Dutch Wadden Sea than the correlation depicted in Figure 74.\n\nGiven the uncertainties surrounding the estimate of return rate for the Dutch Wadden Sea, it was necessary to invest most effort in developing a model describing how ostercherates deplete a given food stock and whether they are stressed for food in the process. A short description of the model, including the most important parameters and assumptions is provided in section 1.5.7. For a detailed account we refer to (Rappold et al., 2003d). The amount of food stress calculated with the model increases with a decreasing food supply. In addition, and as expected, the return rate\n\n---\n\n11 The problems with estimating return rate in the Dutch Wadden Sea do not apply to the Oosterschelde. First, the entire Oosterschelde is counted every month, so the extent of imputing needed is small compared to the Wadden Sea. Second, the Oosterschelde is much smaller, so changes in numbers between years may depend more on immigration and emigration than mortality and reproduction. Thus, adjustment to a change of food supply may occur on a shorter time scale compared to the Wadden Sea. This may explain why the relationship between return rate on the one hand and food supply and food stress on the other hand is much tighter for the Oosterschelde than for the Wadden Sea."}

It also does not have anything ultimately existent (paramāthasa). as its intentional object, since its intentional object is devoid of the three times, like a sky-flower. Certainly, an utterance, “He should do this,” (kayādi) does not refer to the present. For then it would have the same content as the utterance, “He does this.” It is not the case that it refers to the future, like the utterance, “He will do this.” It is also not the case that it refers to the past, like the utterance, “He did this.” Prathibā is not a means of knowing, since its intentional object is non-existent. It is not a doubt, since it involves exclusive determination. It is not an error, since it makes everyone undertake actions everywhere.30\n\nAccording to Vācaspati, instances of prathibā represent an action as something to be done. This, in turn, gives rise to an awareness of the action along with its goal, the means to achieve it, and the way to perform it, and results in the performance of the action. This action may be something mundane, like cooking pasta, where the goal of the action is the prepared pasta, the means of action involves the ingredients and utensils needed for cooking, and the way to do it is laid out in the recipe. People have performed this action in the past, are perhaps performing it now, and will perform it in the future. In that sense, it may be described by means of declarative sentences. This is why Vācaspati says that the action in question may be delimited by the three times. The catch, however, is this. Even though the action in question may be delimited by the three times, it is represented by instances of prathibā as delimited by neither the past, nor the present, nor the future. That ensures that the content of that awareness cannot be expressed by means of declarative sentences like, “He does this,” “He will do this,” and “He did this.” In this respect, prathibā, unlike our other sources of knowledge, is directed at an object that is ultimately non-existent. Yet, it is not uncertain in the same way as a state of doubt is. It decisively tells the agent what is to be done. Moreover, since it gives rise to successful action everywhere, it also is not like a state of error.\n\nThe lesson: an instance of prathibā is an awareness which does not represent an action as something that an agent has performed, or is performing, or will perform. In this respect, it does not have any descriptive content at all: it has a distinctively normative content. In this respect, the relevant theory of prathibā is distinct from the Vasiseka theory of prathibā that Maṇḍana criticises elsewhere (see footnote 25). For the Vasiseka, the content of prathibā, e.g., in the case of the girl’s premonition that her brother will arrive the next day, or in the farmer’s premonition that it will rain, is descriptive. But, on this theory, it is irreducibly normative.\n\n30 NK on VṢ 1.13, 405.3-11: na hi te prathibāsaṁ se samvedanam anicayātaṁnam prathibām akāṣṭhāṁ | samāśo hi sah | svam te adityasiddhamatekatrayasūtānamchayāni kṛṣyāni pratipatāni anukālaṁ tattipatthātyā kāṣya vāṇilākamākārya kāntāya sukhaśrītāni kāntāyam iti prathāni prathibām adhyāgamaṁ | evam tamhi kṛṣyāniyā śivaya iti na anirvāyāya cha - prathibām | kṛṣyāntayāya iti kṛṣyāntāyaṁ | a ca tataṁkāryānamchāryāgami vadhā pāṭha padāyāṁ prāṇāyāp adhikāri iti | yam pāṇam atītāniyāgacāramtānamāni anayānamānyā anacānamānam akubhātāriyam ita prathākāyāni prathāti | na pāṇam anṛtā pāṇamāthāsaṁśvāyā kāṭāryānamāchāti kāṭāryāpāṇam | ta bhāta kṛṣyā iti vatāmāndhākā kārtāyā anācāpāṇamāṁ | nāgāṇāti kārtāyāṁ | nātiśā akāriyā iti | tad ca na pāṇamam anācāpāṇāṁ | na samāśo kāntāsaṁśvāṁ | na śivāpāṇāyā samāśaṁ saratam yacāhamāpāpāramāṁ | For a variant, see VṢ 40: 176.6-18."}

You have to be in the right realm to see this, or at least you have to have a vision. Many people today are seeing this, but they won’t cross over. They say, “Brother, it’s blasphemous for you to declare you are God.” Well, I agree with that, and I don’t say I’m God. But I do say this: If Adam is replaced, and God has filled me with His life, and when we come together we express, as the Word says, the fullness of Him who fills everything everywhere with Himself, if I am not Christ, then who am I? Can the Body be of a different nature than the Head? The greatest problem in the universe is man’s mistaken identity. Yet people hear this with Pentecostal ears and they feel that it’s New Age, or they feel it’s seducing spirits.\n\nNo Fear\n\nListen, as long as you’re still in fear, of any kind whatsoever, whether that fear is for yourself, or for those you are ministering to, or fear for the young ones in the Body of Christ, as long as you have fear of any kind, you have not yet entered into the realm of Tabernacles. You have not yet seen that God is all in all. You have not yet seen that “Known unto God are all His works from the beginning of the world” (Acts 15:18). You do not understand that He truly is the head of all principalities and powers in heavenly realms and earthly realms, and above the earth and below the earth, and in the sea and under the sea. You have not yet seen that He is Lord of all, because if you do, you no longer have any fear. If you have fear of being deceived and fear for others being deceived, you don’t know the fullness of God’s love. Known unto God are all of His works.\n\nBecause I have been an avid seeker all my life, I have seen deception. Yet God used that very thing to teach me some things and give me some understanding that I would never have received anywhere else. Even deception will work to your good. Do you think that God birthed you into the world and then just left you alone to work yourself into whatever you needed to be? I know that before my feet ever stepped on this earth, God had a perfect plan and purpose for my life. Not for Gary, not for that identity that I picked up at birth, not really knowing who I was. He has no plan for that. It takes several years of His dealings and workings until you realize that is what you need to let go of. Those who are living by law and will power are afraid to let go of Adam, because they think that if they let go, if they don’t keep Adam in check, then they are going to backslide and go out into the world and do some things they shouldn’t do. I understand that, because I’ve been there. But until you let go, you’ll never know if God is able to keep you.\n\nYou have to understand what I’m saying here. If God has really called you (and He has), then you’re going to go through some of the most horrible fires of tribulation. You are going to be molded to such a degree that sometimes you will despair of life itself. There have been times in my past when I wished, literally, I could die, because I was on the potter’s wheel. There have been times when I’ve said, “God, if when I was a young Christian I could have had the vision that I have now, I wouldn’t have had to suffer so much.” And it’s not even that I wouldn’t have had to suffer so much, but I could have done it in joy. But see, we’re short-sighted. Scripture says that Jesus endured the Cross because He saw beyond it (Heb. 12:2)."}

As there is no reference regarding the social economy principles in the legal regulations for sheltered workshops, in the recent report issued by Institute of Social Economy (CSDF) in August 2013 it is considered that only sheltered workshops organized in traditional forms of social economy (associations, foundations, cooperatives) could be included in the field of work integration social enterprise. The sheltered workshops have the benefit of reserved markets as all employees in Romania have to either hire disabled employees or to buy services of goods from protected workshops.\n\nSheltered workshops registered in Romania are in great majority for profit companies (69% from total, 39% sheltered workshops), some of the companies being also commercial subsidiaries of non-profit organizations (association or foundations). According to General Direction for Protection of Persons with Disabilities, legal forms assimilated to social economy represented in August 2012 only 23% in total sheltered workshops; 95 associations, 20 cooperatives and 14 foundations. At the end of 2012, sheltered workshops employed an approximate number of 4600 persons, from which approximately 2000 persons with disabilities, representing 42% in total employees for this type of organization, average close to legal condition of 30%.\n\nBesides the role of creating jobs for people with disabilities, according to the research results of IES report 2013, 47% of total sheltered workshops provide supplementary services for employees with disabilities like professional training (27% from total sheltered workshops, 37% from sheltered workshops developed by social economy organizations), counseling and information services (14% from total sheltered workshops, 25% from sheltered workshops developed by social economy organization).\n\nThe draft Law on Social Economy from September 2012 introduces a new category of social enterprises, work integration social enterprises which would lead to an extension of sheltered workshop activities towards work integration of other categories of vulnerable groups than the disabled and also incorporating the social economy principles in their operation, and without the benefit of the reserved markets.\n\n3. Case study of a pilot rural territory where a comprehensive social economy start-up project has been developed **Heroza Romania** dealsi project. What would be the role of social economy in a territorial development in **Heroza**? Value chain analysis.\n\nThe territory: general description and resources\n\nThe territory - five facilities from the South West Carpathian region in Romania – Heroza – a market town, and four rural municipalities Costesti, Vaideeni, Maladresti and Slatiosara as a strategic partnership “Oltenia at the feet of the Mountains – Partnership for Local Economic Development”. The Heroza micro region lies at 200 km away from Romania’s capital Bucharest, between the Căpățânii Mountains to the north, and little mountain rivers to the other parts. It is mainly a highland region, with mountains reaching altitudes of up to 2.124 m in the Ural Peak, two rows of hills and depresasionary corridors, among which stands out the Heroza Valley.\n\nHeroza, the market town around which the network of localities has evolved has a population of approximately 7,000 living in an area of 118 square kilometers. Heroza is reputed as an ethnographic centre and as an age-old folk ceramics centre, famous for well preserved traditions and crafts, rich cultural, spiritual and architectural heritage (old churches and monasteries, most famous traditional pottery centers in Romania).\n\nTraditional occupations include fruit production, animal rearing (bovines, goats and, sheep), ceramics/ pottery, and wood-processing industry. Heroza is also a traditional commercial centre; a market area for farming products and (household) utilities exchange. Finally, the name of Heroza is linked with the Monastery of Hruce, which is a monastic complex erected at the end of the XVIII century, and which is listed in the UN World Heritage Site, a masterpiece of orthodox religious architecture, and also a cultural centre that influences the development of crafts such as tapestry and ceramics in the region. The Heroza ethnographical area blends elements specific of several civilizations: the clay civilisation – famous potters, the wood civilization – talented wood-carvers and the pastoral civilization – on the alpine\n\n---\n\n10 Constantinescu St. (coord.), Social Economy and working force employment.

Stress interferes with personal well-being and can weaken performance (Folkman, Lazarus, Gruen, & DeLongis, 1986). When teachers are stressed and not coping well, the relationships they have with students are likely to suffer, leading to negative academic and behavioral outcomes for students (Wentzel, 2010).\n\nPersistent stress can result in professional burnout. Burnout is the accumulation of responses to extended stressors caused by one’s job; characteristics of burnout are emotional exhaustion, cynicism (depersonalization), and low levels of self-efficacy (Maslach, Schaufeli, & Leiter, 2001). Emotional exhaustion is a response to an overwhelming amount of demand from one’s job (Maslach et al., 2001). Inefficacy comes from excessive demands and not enough resources to meet those demands; it is defined by self-perceived ineffectiveness (Maslach et al., 2001). The transactional model of stress proposes that stress and burnout occur when an individual has a negative appraisal between the demands placed upon them and their abilities to sufficiently cope with those demands (Sapolsky, 1998). Thus, teacher burnout, stress, coping, and self-efficacy are likely interrelated and multidirectional.\n\nTeacher burnout has been linked to teacher turnover intentions and job absenteeism (Belcastro & Gold, 1983) as well as irritability and diminished performance (Huberman, Grounauer, & Marti, 1993). A common conceptualization of burnout includes three components that are related to implementation of classroom practices, including emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and sense of personal accomplishments from the job (Maslach, Jackson, & Leiter, 1996). In particular, emotional exhaustion, defined as the “tired and fatigued feeling that develops as emotional energies are drained” (Maslach et al., 1996, p. 28), is likely to interfere with a teacher’s efforts to implement effective instructional practices and may influence the development of negative attitudes about and interactions with students (Lamude, Scudeler, & Furn-Lamude, 1992).\n\nNot surprisingly, teacher burnout and stress have been shown to negatively influence teacher and student wellbeing (Beer & Beer, 1992; Gwynn, 2007). Specifically, Gwynn (2007) found that teacher behaviors elicited negative student behaviors, such as harming school property, criticizing other students, and talking back to the teacher. In addition, Kokkinos (2007) found that teacher burnout was significantly associated with higher levels of student antisocial and oppositional/defiant behaviors (e.g., cruelty/bullying, rudeness, deceiving or makes fun of schoolmates).\n\nCoping is as lens considered aspect of teacher functioning, perhaps because it may be perceived as synonymous with stress. In fact, stress and coping are distinct constructs and each contributes important understanding to individual adaptation. Stress results from an imbalance between demands and resources that are available. Coping refers to the person’s cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage (reduce, minimize, master, or tolerate) the internal and external demands of this person-environment transaction (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Therefore, it is possible for individuals to experience high levels of stress and still report adequate coping skills (Brenner & Bartel, 1984). This distinction may be especially relevant in today’s high pressure school settings where most, if not all adults, may experience stressful environments but may have great variability in individual coping responses.\n\nTeacher Self-Efficacy\n\nTeacher self-efficacy is also negatively associated with teacher stress and burnout with available evidence suggesting reciprocal effects over time (Brouwers & Tomic, 1999). Similar to teacher burnout and stress, self-efficacy is associated with classroom management (Reinke et al., 2013). Conceptually, teachers who feel more confident in their capacity to manage classrooms behaviors are more likely to deliver effective practices and observe positive student outcomes. In turn, positive student responses to effective classroom management serves as a positive feedback loop for increasing self-efficacy and the likelihood the teacher will deliver effective practice in the future (Han & Weiss, 2005). On the contrary, lack of confidence or efficacy may interfere with a teacher’s ability to be effective in meeting the needs of students. For instance, Pas, Bradshaw, Hershfield, and Leot (2010) found that teachers with low efficacy were less likely to make referrals for their students to student support teams.\n\nTeacher efficacy is also related to student academic achievement. In a study on the academic gains made in a school year of primary school students, Muja and Reynolds (2002) found that academic achievement and yearly gains were best predicted by teacher behavior. In addition, they found that teacher self-efficacy and subject knowledge affected teacher behavior, thereby creating an indirect relationship to student academic achievement. Self-efficacy predicts future behavior. Self-efficacy theory suggests that if a teacher experiences success on a task, then he/she is likely to believe that he/she will be successful again in that task (Tschannen-Moran & Kite, 2007). Conversely, if a teacher perceives that he/she is not proficient in managing student behaviors or promoting the academic achievement of their students, then the teacher will be less likely to attempt to further affect these areas. Notably, self-efficacy is a malleable teacher characteristic that can be altered through cognitive restructuring and mastery experiences (Bandura, 1997). Thus, building self-efficacy and improved"}

I wish I could. I feel that humanity is crucified by managed money and by 'wise and competent mer' deciding what shall happen to widow Jones and to the humble investor who has saved up his money in the hope of doing something with it. I have told this to Donald McLaughlin and he, I think, is duly aware of my thoughts - that it is dishonest and cynical today to the people of the United States, as if they were second-rate citizens, the right to convert their currency.\n\n\"Are we slaves that foreign central bankers can cynically decide whether their central bank is going to draw some more gold, as they have drawn over $1 billion in the last nine months, while American citizens are not afforded an equal choice of the kind of money they may prefer for their individual or company protection? I believe that politically we can enact the gold-con standard of money and should do so. And the people who haven't felt the pulse of America are going to feel it in no uncertain terms very soon\" (pp. 58-59).\n\nWhat Mr. McKenna is overlooking, of course, is that Mr. Kitz's 'cash intellectual manner' is backed by a wealth of knowledge about central banking practices. Mr. Kitz is fully aware of the extent to which the American people have been \"robbed\" and \"crucified\" in the past by the very type of gold convertibility that Mr. McKenna wants. It was the convertible dollar of the 1920s that finally led to the collapse of credit and resulting foreclosures, unemployment, and panics between debtors and creditors during the depression of the 1930s. Mr. Kitz was not alone in the belief that the program Mr. McKenna wants us to follow was would result in the same type of drastic deflation from which we have suffered so often in the past. Several of the men present voiced fears of a deflation if such a program were adopted now.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. McKenna's righteous indignation with the present money system, which is tied to nothing at all and which is steadily withering away the value of our dollar, is also well justified. There is no question but that many millions of hard-working Americans are being robbed under the present system. The value of their savings is being destroyed by a steady inflation of the per-capita supply of dollars.\n\nThe only logical way out of this tangle is to abandon the gold-credit mechanism and adopt the type of system that is implied the views of Richard H. Smith. There is no other way - consistent with a free-enterprise economy - of protecting ourselves from both inflation and deflation.\n\nMr. George made the point that before the United States should consider restoring domestic convertibility, it would be absolutely necessary that a number of other countries put into effect \"reforms ... that would be extremely radical and difficult and politically unpalatable.\" (p. 62). Mr. McKenna then asked:\n\n\"Is it wrong that Americans should have good money when foreigners have not yet attained good money? Couldn't Americans have good money even though other countries can't afford good money? Don't Americans deserve it because we would murder and cause the money to come into the Treasury in exchange for our labor and our risk-taking? What is wrong with Americans having better money? We have better automobiles and better everything else. \\textit{Better money would be a leadership for the world.}\\(^{2}\\)\" (p. 65) (italics added)\n\nMr. McKenna is absolutely right! America does deserve a good money. And without any question, \"better money would be a leadership for the world.\" But the hard fact is that gold is not as good a money as we could have, because is supply does not keep pace with population. And gold-credit is a still worse money, because it collapses periodically. And another hard fact is that gold is an international commodity - and therefore, if our money is linked to gold, we must consider the situations that exist in other gold-standard countries. It would be foolhardy not to. You can rest assured that the speculators in foreign exchange are keenly aware of the relative strength of the credit situations in different countries. For us to ignore the situations that exist in other gold-standard countries would be to invite disaster.\n\nIn other words, if we stick to gold, it's unfortunate but true that Americans can't have as good a money as they deserve. And it's also true as Mr. George pointed out, that certain basic reforms in other countries are needed before we can get the gold standard working as it used to work. And that means \"including\" in foreign affairs - a process that is repugnant to most Americans. If we don't meddle, there's no possibility of making the gold standard work; and if we do meddle, we get a standard we don't want anyhow because of the \"barbarous\" way in which it works. It should be easy for us to make up our minds what to do when"}

I believe some aspects of his class are too difficult though. Maybe I just did not prepare myself for the workload this semester, but I was under the impression of a 4 credit class would reasonably take 8-12 hours of preparation outside of class per week. The required time to complete the assignments easily shouldered or stripped that each week. I understand that in Google IT mind, an insane amount of time is needed to requirements to completing the assignments, but when the only undergraduate group I know that got full points before the deadline admitted to spending hours of hours on them, it may as well be a requirement, as I sustain that like this. It is easy to feel like your performance is often being judged by your ability to grasp the concepts expected by the course syllabus, but by your willingness and ability to spend inordinate amounts of time on a single assignment. However, I do understand that Google IT must be the course to be challenging and worth the effort. I can say that every hour put into this class is worth it in terms of personal growth and learning, just not everyone can afford to put in a lot of work. Great class feedback at always the submission, and the course based on the modern practices of modern society. Overall though I feel as though students would be more receptive to learning when more manageable goals are laid out before them.\n\n- Geoffrey Gibbon enjoyed his opening of the course quite well. CS Edgely, his integration of humor with course material was profound, indicative of a humble, superior level of intelligence. I can't calculate how appreciative of him for the academically safe of lecture material. Some people are not fortunate enough to be in the \"full-time residential student\" life, and it's extremely discouraging when attending to responsibilities resulting in fails behinding/unbecoming amnesiacs in classes. TLDR: 10/10 would recommend would do it a favor.\n\n- Dr. Charlton (you are a fresh preeminent that remedied all of the course in a way that was engaging, memorable, and funny for their name a top decath at all of the successful implementations an any right to, which greatly helped on examination).\n\n- Enthusiastic and clear professor. Clearly spent time putting together course materials and designing infrastructure of course so that technical issues would not hold us back from working on assignments. His personal presence was accurate without going away many times.\n\n- I felt like only minutes passed should be asked, and I felt every instructor in asking during questions. This is a general feeling in the computer science department and I believe should be addressed. Some students who felt like they were behind, only got more behind, because of fear of scrutiny of the TAs, other students, and the professors.\n\n- There are 2 sides to Geoffrey. He is in a great mood or he is in a bad mood. I think that is the a generally a really nice guy but you do not want to get on his bad side.\n\n- He makes students feel very welcome during office hours, he seemed hostile and rude at times so students who were struggling but nice to others who had a better understanding. I was personally scared of interacting with him due to the way he treated students during office hours.\n\n- Instructor assumes everyone has basic CS knowledge when teaching while that is not always true.\n\n- The prof has really gone a lot. Had loads of fun.\n\n- Very effective.\n\n- Very effective. I liked how we used anecdotes throughout the lectures.\n\n- I found no faults in this course other than it being difficult, but in a good way.\n\n- Geoff made sure to come to lecture because of its engaging teaching style. He is entertaining and cranks out of information into each lecture, but it is very easy to digest.\n\n- The enthusiasm that Callahan exhibited was amazing, I really felt had been missed every single class. I never felt bored in the classes. As I mentioned we were supported by the course staff, the opportunity to submit multiple times allowed us to experiment a lot. The 3rd assignment course gave less time for comps and more time for other profs marks, also the targets couldn't been released early as that people couldn't give more time to the course.\n\n- The lectures were among my favorite during my time at ULB. But, the assignments were among my worst and most time consuming assignments.\n\n- It is so hard for me to, due to this, it's instaling on us every day.\n\n- He is almost the same with the made. And it is very difficult.\n\n- This is by far the best professor I've had at ULB and really makes the course an enjoyable experience. He's super knowledgeable when it comes to course material, and you can tell he's enjoying it. The course is definitely hard, but his office hours are inviting and helpful, and he's always positive and funny. He's dedicated to the learning of his students as well as the entire CS department.\n\n- I was excellent this in course. Giving the correct balance of well presented material, well defined goals, and solid guidance when seeking help in office hours.\n\n- The instructor presented the material in an organized, easy-to-follow, and entertaining manner.\n\n- Good, likes to say \"right\" as it but he gets better at it. Enthusiastic, likes to make jokes and flip your during lecture.\n\n- He was very effective. Maybe the only thing you'd need to give me a good background on the assignments and more direction in doing them. Given the size of the assignments, I seemed very difficult to have to rely on the TAs for instruction on how to do them even with a plethora of office hours.\n\n- He taught well, and made each class interesting.\n\n- He was very good in his teachings. Also, He is Qute :)\n\n- Callahan was very effective and knowledgeable in his explanation of concepts. His enthusiasm showed in every class. He truly likes to teach (excepting Systems).\n\n- I enjoyed having Geoff as a professor for this course! Me, Geoff was very effective in teaching the conceptual aspects of the course, and I enjoyed attending the lectures. There was a disconnect in the difficulty of the conceptual aspects of the course and the programming aspects. I was disconnected could have been allowed by a more detailed set of assignment descriptions, as stated earlier in my evaluation. This is my in-my-consternation, and it stems from the amount of struggling I did on the assignments. I have shown that CS/EDUCAT is a lifetime choice to the level of my ULB students REGARDLESS of who teaches it. I think there is a systemic problem: either the 4th/2/3 course itself, or the way ULB curriculum to the way that most profs are in the course. Everything being used, I would completely recommend Geoff for any class. His enthusiasm, willingness to help, and the way that he makes the entire course (notes, lectures, recitations, etc.) available online show that he is dedicated to student.\n\n- He is the best computer science teacher I have come across in my life so far!\n\n- His enthusiasm for the topic was greatly reflected in his method of instruction. He explained topics quite thoroughly and made learning the material quite enjoyable\n\n- Prof's ORA is really good and knows it well. His notes and lecture videos aid videos really helped me learn the subject. :)\n\n- Unapproachable: I loved teaching Geoff, but, the exposure to it alone was too many things.\n\n- He is awesome! I loved his knowledge, style, and always interested in everyone and CS. He worked in diverse directions better. But he provided another angle to how to design systems and tradeoffs. He is one of the best teachers I have listened to the date.\n\n- Great professor. He's a little intimidating but just made me see my office source problem service forgoing go help for"}

It seems that delays in motor detectable on speech than music, for starters. Also, it was found that the amount of tolerable delay was roughly inversely proportional to the crossover frequency.\n\nWith a 100Hz crossover, there was an audible change in the sound by adding a 15ms delay to the satellites (placing the subwoofers \"ms\" ahead\" of the satellites). However, if the delay was added to the vowels, an additional 45ms of delay (making a total of 55ms) was required for audibility. With a 200Hz crossover, the allowable additional delays began 9 and 22ms respectively. So, said Poh Ser, by choosing a lower crossover frequency, the designer can reduce the audibility of any given amount of delay.\n\nTurning to his current subwoofer design, Poh Ser explained that his goal was to reduce both distortion and enclosure size while retaining high acoustic output at low frequencies. The new subwoofer had a/hy internal volume of his previous design (4 cu. ft. instead of 8), yet has 8dB more output at 3% distortion.\n\nPoh Ser's approach was to mount \\*10\\* 12\" drivers facing each other at the same end of a cylindrical enclosure. This presence each driver with a \"virtual enclosure\" which is twice the apparent volume of the real one (each driver \"sees\" only half the presence in the enclosure; hence each driver's hands that it is operating in an enclosure which is twice as big). Also, by mounting them facing each other, even-order distortion products are mostly eliminated. By choosing drivers with very little odd order-harmonics in the operating range, very low distortion is achieved. On the flip side of the coin, efficiency is 3dB lower. Luckily, power is cheap these days, and the vowels used can handle very high power.\n\nLike all Poh Ser's designs, this is a vented system (for efficiency and more important, \\*higher maximum output at the lower frequencies\\*). In a direct crossfade, in part out more 16-20Hz than a Hartley 24\" woofer, the latter developing a rubbing noise cold during the test. The port is a large element (6 inches) tube, with the opening at the bottom. (The drivers are mounted at the top.) Poh Ser commented that most commercial systems use too small a port, resulting in compression and \"chuffing\" noises due to the extreme velocity of the air in the port. 18-inch woofer are frequently coupled with a 4-inch port (in an 800,500 system, for example). Poh Ser told us that his system is usable from any normal subwoofer crossover frequency—\"200Hz, 100Hz, 50Hz, 30Hz\"—down to below 19Hz, where it is \"1 or 2dB down.\" It still has substantial output at 16Hz.\n\nThere is less hassle boost applied to equal-phase system than was used in his first design. The peak boost occurs around 2Hz, and only is 3dB relative to the \"high\" base (about 30Hz or so), compared with 6dB boost of the first design. There is also a 12dB/octave infrasonic filter, so the net rolloff rate below cutoff is 36dB/octave. The maximum output he has measured from this particular pair of subwoofers is 116dB at 1kHz with 3% distortion. This was in a 33x14x7.5\" basement, the subwoofers against the middle of the front wall (i.e. about 4 feet from the corners), measured at 10 feet from the speakers, at normal ear level. It was measured by Ira using his live and CBS test disc. He did not have the corresponding upbar power, so we did not measure an efficiency figure. Poh Ser did say that the \\*theoretical efficiency\\* of the system is about 87dB/vaat at 1 meter (87dB/vaat at 1 meter in half space corresponds to a little under 2mW acoustic output, i.e., slightly under 0.2 percent efficiency).\n\nThe vowels have a voice-coil resistance of 5 ohms (at dc). Since they are parallel, the minimum impedance presented to an amplifier is under 3 ohms (at the port resonance, around 18Hz)—quite low. This results in a fairly high sensitivity. However, if your ears are worried about the low impedance combined with a possible large phase angle at low frequencies, Poh Ser suggested that the drivers could be wired in series instead of parallel, raising the minimum impedance to over 10 ohms. \"The sensitivity would of course be lower by 1% efficiency is really affected.\"\n\nPoh Ser uses Carver amplifiers at home, by the way (several M1.0s and an M5000). He used his Carver M500 for driving the subwoofers at this setting (it has excellent meters, which allowed us to measure the power fed to the subwoofers during the demonstration. The meters were calibrated before the bench brought to the meeting.) It appeared to drive the under-3-ohm load of the subwoofers without any audible distress, and remained quite cool.\n\nEach channel—Poh Ser recommends dual subwoofers—can handle 300 watts long-term ear usage power. He has not yet melded a driver.\n\nDemonstrations followed, beginning with a Hindmarsh original section (on Argo) in which Poh Ser said that the bass was louder (by about 8dB than the rest of the spectrum (measured using a spectrum analyzer in peak-mhold mode and playing through the entire disc). With approximately 150 watts in, Ira Leontar appeared that we were getting about 110dB out. \"It's almost all around 19Hz, too,\" Poh Ser told us. When the selection was first played, Alf Vestner was heard to exclaim, \"Wow!\"\n\n\"Without the subwoofers and crossover, the dbx 2500s distorted badly on this track, because they were being driven well below their port resonance, which is 1-1/2 octaves higher. Admittedly an unusual case, this is nevertheless a good example of what happens to an \\*unprotected\\* vented system below resonance, as it becomes uncontrolled (Note that in the case of Poh Ser's subwoofers, the built-in high-pass filter prevents such behavior by filtering out below-resonant signals.) I also note that single 6\" sealed 50Hz-resonance woofers would \"distort badly\" when overdriven at 19Hz—2dB.\n\nOf course we heard Poh Ser's favorite demo CD, the Philips recording of Saint-Saens' \\*Organ Symphony\\* (Edo"}

It was a slim dunk when they saw how much they would save with little to no risk. In that position, I came in about 7 am, went to the cafeteria next door to the computer facility for breakfast, then checked out the equipment and retired to my technical space to study and do my homework. About 11:30 am I went back to the cafeteria and had lunch, made one more inspection of the equipment and then went to Long Beach State for classes. Another great set-up because I was single at the time. I completed my bachelor's degree at the same time the use of the small computer was discontinued.\n\nNow to get a job with a Certified Public Accounting (CPA) firm. Long Beach State held a career day near graduation whereas students could interview with prospective employers. This was the early '70s before age discrimination laws. I was 33 at the time. I interviewed with all of the \"Big Eight Accounting Firms\" as they were known then. They were very forthright in telling me I was too old! We want a person less than 25, with a wife and kids, a mortgage and car payments and a picture of his wife and kids on his desk so he will say \"YES\" to the long hours we will ask him to work for little pay. (You had to work two years for a CPA firm to qualify for a CPA license, so they had the leverage.) A guy your age will balk at that, so we will not hire you.\n\nShortly after my last scheduled interview, I ran into the man that organized the career fair and he asked how my interview were going. I told what I had experienced. He thought he could get me an interview with a CPA firm in the next lower tier of larger CPA firms during their lunch break. He made the arrangements and I went to the interview with two representatives of the firm. I decided I would take the lead in this interview. I walked in and said, \"I am 33 years old and if that is a problem for you, let's go have lunch and I will buy!\" Almost shocked them out of their chairs, but they said, \"Let's chat about you here now.\" I got hired.\n\nI worked for this firm almost 4 years doing audits and other accounting work for various clients in many different industries. Toward the end of my third year, a partner came to me on a Friday and said, \"Gary do you have any experience doing percentage of completion accounting? I have a construction client that wants to begin having an annual audit. I want you to work with this client. Come to the office tomorrow and I will teach you percentage of completion accounting.\" I think you may be able to guess who the client was, Raymond. I did work at Raymond and other clients for the CPA firm until August 1976. In August 1976 I became controller at Raymond. I had to convince Carl I would not run off after a short time. I was divorced, since 1968, and Carl said he had been burned when he had hired previous divorced men who later ran off chasing a woman. I convinced Carl I would not do that to him, and he hired me. I married Kay in October 1981 without running off. I am writing this in October 2020, and we are beginning our 40th year together.\n\nI never dreamed of running Raymond.

Prices and wages had been inflated artificially in terms of gold by the expansion of gold-crèdit that had taken place during the 1920s. If we followed Israel's advice, we were in line for a drastic deflation of prices and wages. And although we would eventually recover, it wasn't reasonable to expect 12 million klm in the presence of klk machinery to wait that long.\n\nThe orthodox banking theorists took the stand that a liquidation of bank credit would be a \"wholesome\" thing. And in terms of the proper functioning of the gold-crèdit mechanism, they were right. Confidence was not going to be restored until a deflation of credit took place. But obviously a contraction of the supply of money is not a wholesome thing in terms of the effect it has on human beings.\n\nTo recapitulate: We had a choice of three courses of action after the bank panic:\n\n1) Stick to the gold-crèdit mechanism and follow the sound economic principles of a free market.\n\n2) Stick to the gold-crèdit mechanism -- with a few patches -- and adopt the unsound economic principles of a managed economy.\n\n3) Convert our unsound credit banking system into a sound deposit banking system -- taking care to restore the per capita supply of money to its pre-depression level -- and continue to follow the sound economic principles of a free market.\n\nIf I were forced to choose between 1 and 2 -- as all people who assumed that credit banking is sound were obliged to do -- I suppose I would have taken the second choice out of sheer desperation. I would know -- deep down in my heart -- that a credit's work became a tax based on false premises and unsound economic principles, and instead theories of government. But because of the injustice, and misery and probable revolution that would have resulted from a drastic deflation of prices and wages if we followed the first course of action, I would have resigned myself to the second choice. The great mystery of Americans indicated that they felt the same way.\n\nNow let's discuss some of the measures that were taken, after the bank holiday, to restore confidence in the banking system. Perhaps the most significant step that was taken was the rationalization of our gold supply. No longer did any citizen have the right to hoard gold or to obtain gold by presentation of Federal Reserve Notes. No longer did private individuals have the power to cause a contraction of credit by withdrawing gold.\n\nIn one sense, this was a step in the right direction. No private individual or corporation should have the power to cause a contraction of our supply of money by withdrawing gold from the banking system. But neither should our government have the power to arbitrarily cause an increase or decrease in the supply of money (bank credit). All increased history shows that when governments have that power, they will abuse that power by inflicting the supply of money.\n\nThere is only one way for us to protect ourselves from both private and government abuse of our money. We must have our Constitution state what the per capita supply of money should be. Our Constitution is our only safeguard. It protects us from other abuses by the government -- and it should protect us from the government abuse of our money systemically.\n\nAnother important step that was taken to restore confidence in the banking system was the establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. A word or two about that organization should be of interest to the reader. It was designed to bolster confidence in the banking system by making it appear as though the United States Government was guaranteeing the safety of your deposits. Actually it merely insured individual deposits of member banks up to $5,000. Deposits were not guaranteed.\n\nIt is amusing to remember that one of the arguments used to justify a system of credit banking was that banks operate as insurance companies. We now see that since the banks could not make good when operating as insurance companies, a because necessary to create the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to insure the banks! And the next thing we will need will be some agency to insure the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., because it is just as unsound as the banks. In 1946, for example, there were approximately sixty-seven billion dollars of deposits under $5,000 insured by the F.D.I.C. -- which had about one billion dollars in assets. Today deposits are insured up to $10,000. And as of Dec. 31, 1953, the total amount insured was estimated to be one over hundred and four billion dollars. Behind this was a deposit insurance fund of only 1.39% of that amount, slightly under one-and-a-half billion dollars.

Moreover, there were many practical difficulties to be met in implementing any general principles relating to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.\n\n109. Another view was that the difficulties stemmed from the fact that conditions concerning religion in different States varied in the extent: in every State there were to be found not only followers of numerous religions or beliefs, among whom there were conflicting convictions, but also atheism, who maintained non-religious convictions. While religion had a sacred character for its followers, those who held non-religious beliefs were equally entitled to maintain their beliefs and to be protected against discrimination, since to them their convictions were also sacred. It was thus necessary to establish a balance between those who professed a religion and those who did not. According to this view there could be no freedom of conscience in a State in which adherents of one religion or belief held a privileged position and there was discrimination against adherents of other religions or beliefs. Nor could there be freedom of conscience in a State in which there was discrimination against religions holding active beliefs. Separation of Church and the State, and of the Church and the schools, was an essential guarantee of freedom of conscience. Where religion or belief was held in the State, either officially or by ties of an ideological or economic nature, it was merely a weapon to be used by the State in carrying out its policy.\n\n110. Members generally agreed that the Commission should not attempt to examine theoretical ideas or concepts, but should examine upon the elaboration of practical rules for freedom of religion and other beliefs which could be universally applied.\n\n111. There was considerable discussion in the Commission of the meaning to be attributed to the word \"belief\", as used in the draft principles prepared by the Sub-Commission. Reference was made to the fact that in the footnote on page 4 of his Study of Discrimination in the Matter of Religious Rights and Practices Mr. Krishnaswami had stated that: \"In view of the difficulty of defining 'religion', the term 'religious or belief' is used ... to include, in addition to various theistic credos, such other beliefs as agnosticism, free thought, atheism and rationalism.\" During the discussion some members pointed out the footnote expressed only the personal point of view of the Special Rapporteur and had no special significance. Other members supported the definition of the words \"religion or belief\" given in Mr. Krishnaswami's study. They pointed out that the use of these two words in the document to be drawn up would ensure freedom and non-discrimination both with respect to persons professing a religion and with respect to persons adhering to atheistic beliefs. It was also recalled that the term \"religion or belief\" had been used both in article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in article 18 of the draft Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n112. In the view of some members the use of the term \"religion or belief\" to include not only those who followed a religion but also those who held non-religious beliefs which was wrong in principle because it gave the impression that the two were equivalent, which was not so. In their opinion religion was much more than private prayer or public worship; it was at the basis of the whole conception of life of a religious man, permeating his thinking and his deeds in relation to his Creator, and having a profound influence upon other aspects of his life and as individual and in his bearing towards other people and towards society as a whole. They also stated that because of its unique and transcendental character and its comprehensive and pervasive nature, religion could not, in principle, be put on the same footing with agnosticism, free-thought, atheism and rationalism. On the other hand, it was pointed out that it was absurd to attempt to place religion above atheistic belief.\n\n113. Other members, while recognising the importance of distinguishing between religion and belief where individuals were concerned, were of the opinion that from the point of view of the State that distinction was irrelevant: the State should show the same tolerance with regard to both religion and non-religious beliefs although it should permit freedom to be invoked to protect those who wished to attach and destroy religion. In their external manifestations, religious and non-religious beliefs should be respected equally. It was pointed out that the Sub-Commission clearly had intended the draft principles to prohibit all discrimination in matters of belief, whether religious or non-religious, as evidenced by the fact that it had used the expression \"religion or belief\" to less than twenty three times, as well as by its enunciator, in paragraph 1 of part I of the draft principles, of the right of everyone to adhere or not to adhere to a religion or belief.\n\n114. Several members strongly favoured the use of the term \"religion or belief\" throughout the principles, both as a marker of consistency and because the term \"non-religious beliefs\" might be interpreted as including political or other secular beliefs. In the opinion of others, the absence of the word \"religion\" made no difference, as the word \"belief\" should be interpreted in the broadest possible sense. One member felt that there was no need for the use systematically of the term \"religion or belief\" and in particular of the term \"or belief\" in certain of the draft principles, such as those having application exclusively to priests or ministers of religion.\n\n115. Another issue which arose in the course of the general debate was that of the individual and social characteristics of religion. One view was that the draft principles were seriously defective in that they stressed mainly the freedom of the individual and did not adequately protect the rights of religious groups and such. It was maintained that the religious rights of individuals could not be guaranteed to the fullest extent unless the community character of religion was taken into account and the rights resulting therefrom were also guaranteed; such rights included, for example, the right of a religious community to organize its adherents in groups, the right of its central authorities to give directives of a binding nature on matters of"}

Serum lycopene and vitamin A concentrations have been found to be significantly lower in asthmatics than in those without asthma [132,133]. In contrast, vitamin E intake is generally unrelated to asthma status but the level of vitamin E in serum is significantly lower in severe asthmatics than in mild asthmatics [133]. Among children, consumption of fresh fruits, particularly fruits high in vitamin C, has been related to a lower prevalence of asthma symptoms and improved lung functions [132,133]. Dietary supplementation or adequate intake of lycopene, vitamin A, flavonoids, and vitamin C rich foods may be beneficial in asthmatic subjects. As for the prevention of the airway disease, many foods may affect development of COPD [132]. Food rich in vitamin C and E may play an especially important role in the prevention and treatment of bronchial asthma.\n\nIn fact, studies on lung function decrement and bronchial asthma in adults suggest that daily intake of vitamin C at levels exceeding the current recommended dietary allowance (60 mg/day among nonsmokers and 100 mg/day among smokers) may have a protective effect [132]. In one study, an increase of 40 mg/day in vitamin C intake led to an approximate 20 mL increase in FEV\\textsubscript{1} [132]. An epidemiological study on the impact of dietary selenium and carotenoids on major causes of mortality and morbidity (including asthma) in elderly women showed a lower risk of mortality in subjects with higher serum selenium and serum total carotenoids levels [175].\n\nVolatile Compounds\n\nPhytocides\n\nPhytocides are natural volatile compounds emitted by trees and plants as a protective mechanism against the harmful insects and animals or microorganisms. The major ingredients of phytocide are highly volatile terpenoids such as α-pinene, carene, and myrcene [176]. Terpenoids are frequently found in essential oils from plants. Monoterpenoids have been isolated from the oils of many higher plants and are valuable in the perfumery and flavor industries. They are also found in nature as insect pheromones and defense secretions and in many marine organisms, where they are usually halogenated. There are four different types of phytocide solutions introduced by Japanese researchers; chemical components released from trees (A-type), highly bactericidal plants (AB-type), flowering grass (D-type), and non-allergic plants (G-type) [176]. Inhalation of phytocides is reported as forest bathing and aromatherapy (relaxing effects) [177, 178] as well as antibacterial effects [179,180]. Chemical and pharmacological studies have shown that some species produce active principles that exert anti-gastropathic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and radical scavenging activity [181-183]. It has been reported that physiological effects of phytocides contribute to the improvement of various disorders including accelerated aging, allergies, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson disease [176].\n\nIn addition, phytocide is reported to enhance the activity of human NK cells [184]. It has also been introduced that fragrance from trees has a regulatory effect on immune function in humans and a restorative effect on the stress-induced immune suppression in mice [185,186].\n\nThere is no report about the roles of phytocide in asthma. However, we have found that administration of phytocide solution reduces asthmatic phenotypes of an animal model of asthma,"}

Those attending voted that the Chapel would become Kure Memorial Evangelical Church and affiliated with North Carolina Synod of the United Lutheran Church of America.\n\nThat organizational meeting marks the birthday of Kure Memorial Evangelical Lutheran Church. Eighteen adults were present at that meeting including Mrs. Laura Kure Williford, Miss Anne Kure, Margaret and Robert Ford, Bessie and Fred Schenk, Lawrence C. Kure, Oscar and Anna Lee Wren, Isabel and Merritt Foshnee, Betty Kure (Mrs. A. E. Sr.) and Jean Gore (later Jean Kure, Mrs. A. E. Jr.). The group adopted a constitution and elected the following church council members: Lawrence C. Kure, Vice Chairman, Margaret Ford, Secretary, Anne Kure, Treasurer and W. E. Williford, Sunday School Superintendent and Council Members Robert Ford, Oscar Wrenn, Merritt Foshnee and Fred Schenk. The council decided to leave the charter membership open until one month after the arrival of a full time Pastor.\n\nOn Sunday evening, August 26, 1951 the new church held a special service to mark the organization of Kure Memorial Evangelical Lutheran in the barracks church building. Celebrants were Rev. K.Y. Huddle of St. Matthews Lutheran, Rev. J. Frank Davis of St. Paul’s Lutheran and seminarian Jack Martin. The congregation applied for membership in the North Carolina Synod on October 7, 1951. Rev. Huddle and Rev. Davis continued with Sunday evening services throughout the winter months.\n\nThe first congregational meeting was held on January 9, 1952. There was $227.14 in the general fund and $86.10 in the building fund. 75 members were on the roll with an average Sunday"}

On the first interpretation, this linguistic operation is designated or directly conveyed (*abhidheyá*) by exhortative verbal endings: when a linguistically competent agent hears an exhortative verbal ending, she becomes aware of the linguistic operation in question, and thereby performs the relevant action. On the second interpretation, designation (*abhidhā*), i.e., the operation by means of which linguistic expressions directly convey their meanings to linguistically competent hearers, itself is the motivating linguistic operation. It is unclear which of these two views is actually the view Kumārila endorses. Finally, according to a semantic approach (*arthavidhivāda*), a *vidhi* is just an extralinguistic object that constitutes the meaning of exhortative verbal endings and motivates a hearer to act under suitable circumstances (VV’s §§6-7). Prabhākara Misra and his followers, arguably, defend a semantic theory of *vidhi*.\\(^{11}\\)\n\nIn the first negative half of VV, Mañdana considers all three approaches to *vidhi*, and discusses arguments against them. In the second half, he offers his own semantic theory of *vidhi*. In the rest of this section, I sketch his preferred theory of *vidhi*.\n\nFocus just on the imperatives (2)-(4). These are of different kinds: the first is an order (*ājñā*), the second is a request (*abhayarthan*), and the third is a permission (*anajñā*). Ordinary exhortations like (2)-(4) are issued by an enjöiner (*injyot*) who prompts another agent, i.e., the enjöinee (*injyāya*), to act.\n\nNotice that an enjöiner typically uses orders and requests to make the enjöinee perform an action that will promote her own interests. For example, if a farmer orders her assistant to bring the cow (so that the cow can be milked), she does so because it helps her satisfy a standing desire she has. Similarly, if I request you to teach my son, I may do so because that action serves my interests. Things are different with permissions. For example, if my nephew asks me if he can get an ice-cream and I ask him to do whatever he likes, it is not obvious that I am thereby\n\n\\(^{10}\\) This operation is sometimes called *kādhāmatikā bhāvanā* (literally, verbal effectuation). See Kumārila’s *Tantravartika* on *Mīmāṃsāvāra* 2.1.1 (TV II.344.14-16): “Of those, that operation, which belongs to linguistic expressions like exhortative verbal endings and which motivates a person towards object-directed effectuation (*arthavidhā* bhāvanā), is the second kind of effectuation (*bhāvanā*), which is a property of linguistic expressions, which has the nature of designation (*abhidhā*), and which is said to be the *vidhi*.” (*arthavidhānyakāya bhāvāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyānāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyayāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyīyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāyāya*).\n\n\\(^{11}\\) Throughout this essay, I will take the meaning (*anāhi* or any linguistic expression roughly, speaking to the object that is conveyed to a linguistically competent hearer by that expression. On the Prabhākara view that Mañdana presents, the meaning of exhortative verbal endings is *injyāya* or injunzione, also referred to as *āpivā* (VV’s §7, or VV°°: 36-78). When an agent hears an exhortative verbal ending in the context of an exhortation addressed to her, she undergoes an awareness-referent of the form. “I am enjöined” (*anāhi*). Such self-categorization are supposed to track an entity called *injyāyāya*—according to one interpretation, something to be done or brought about—which is not accessible by any means of knowing other than language, and, unlike other entities that are part of the natural fabric of reality, does not exist in the past, the present, or the future. For discussion of this view in its sources, see Prabhākara Misra’s sub-community *Bharti* on *Mīmāṃsāvāra* 2.1.5 along with Sāṅkaraṇa Misra’s *Bṛhatsamhitā* (Br 319-324) and the second chapter of Sāṅkaraṇa’s *Vājapeyhaṃtārākā* in *Prakaraṇaprakāśa* (PP 417-450). For discussion of Prabhākara’s view, see Clooney (1990, pp. 245ff) and Yoshimizu (1997, pp. 96ff)."}

In the event that the signs are removed, the points of attachment to the building can be similarly patched and repainted so that the historic design appeared unimpaired. This guideline is therefore met.\n\n10. Hierarchy of compatibility. Exterior alterations and additions will be designed to be compatible primarily with the original resource, secondarily with adjacent properties, and finally, if located within a Historic or Conservation District, with the rest of the district. When practical, compatibility will be pursued on all three levels.\n\nFindings: The proposed signs are compatible sized and located so as to support the historic design as well as the overall ambiance of the surrounding properties. This guideline is therefore met.\n\nRiver District Design Guidelines and Central City Fundamental Design Guidelines\nThe River District is planned to become a place that is remarkable within the region. The area is intended to grow with this special and diverse qualities that are, or will become characteristic of Portland. Further, the River District will accommodate a significant portion of the region's population growth. The plan calls for the creation of a new community of dense neighborhoods, housing a residential population of over 15,000 people, and providing jobs, services, and recreation to this population and others. This area is intended to emphasize the joy of the river, connections to it, and create a sense of community. The goals frame the urban design direction for Central City and River District development.\n\nThe Central City Fundamental Design Guidelines and the River District Design Guidelines focus on four general categories. (A) **Potential Personality**, addresses design issues and elements that reinforce and enhance Portland's character. (B) **Pedestrian Emphasis**, addresses design issues and elements that contribute to a successful pedestrian environment. (C) **Project Design**, addresses specific building characteristics and their relationships to the public environment. (D) **Special Areas**, provides design guidelines for the four special areas of the Central City.\n\nRiver District Design Goals\n1. Extend the river into the community to develop a functional and symbolic relationship with the Willamette River.\n2. Create a community of distinct neighborhoods that accommodates a significant part of the region's residential growth.\n3. Enhance the District's character and livability by fostering attractive design and activities that give comfort, convenience, safety and pleasure to all its residents and visitors.\n4. Strengthen connections within River District, and to adjacent areas."}

So they threw stones at him, beat him with sticks and staves, spit at him, demeaned and hurled insults at him, and ostracized him. And yet, for years upon years Bodhisattva Jofukyo continued to put his palms together and praise every person he encountered, despite their persecution of him. After a while, the people gradually began to realize that the way they were treating Jofukyo was not right. While on the other hand, Bodhisattva Jofukyo realized that in past lives he had behaved the same way as the people who were now persecuting him. He thought that what was happening to him was the result of actions and decisions he had made in the past. That is why he continued to praise every person he met.\n\nIt is not a matter of a person who has no sense, or who is crazy, or who does bad things. In some way, everyone acts that way. For instance, when you say something or do something that you think is good for another person, it may not be a good thing. It may be your perception that your actions or your words are good, but they may not be. In that sense, what you think is good may be bad for the other person. In this life, just because you think you you’ve done five good things and three bad things, and that the effects of the bad things will be erased because you did more good things, it doesn’t work that way. For the good things, accept them as the result of good deeds. And when bad things happen, also accept them, for there are reasons they came your way.\n\nIn some circumstances, people might think, “Oh, I’ve done something wrong, so I can just apologize and be done with it.” But it doesn’t work that way either. After you make the apology, you have to live with the awareness that you did something in the past to bring this about. You take responsibility for and accept the results of your past actions, and in this life you change your behavior.\n\nBI: Is that what karma⁷ is?\n\nRH: Yes\n\n⁴ Bodhisattva Jofukyo - Bodhisattva Fukyo – a bodhisattva described in the 20th chapter of the Lotus Sutra who revered everyone for their innate Buddha-nature, and was persecuted because of his compassionate behavior.\n⁵ Gongyo – the practice of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism which entails the morning and evening recitation of the 2nd and 16th chapters of the Lotus Sutra and chanting Namumyōhōrengekyō.\n⁶ Namumyōhōrengekyō - the Mystic Law which enlightens all Buddhas; the Supreme Law of life and the universe; the Buddha-nature in all things.\n⁷ Karma – thoughts, words and deeds which determine a person’s reality. Past thoughts, words and deeds influence the outcome in the present, just as present thoughts, words and deeds influence the outcome in the future."}

Brad Henry noted, throughout a bond cycle, some projects go over and some under budget which allows for a balancing of costs. The district will also look into interest earnings to help cover overages if necessary. Carrie Douglas asked what factors are causing the increase costs. Eastwood said lower and materials have significantly increased in the past years for all types of construction, and with a hard bid process there really is no room for negotiation. Henry explained how the district estimates bond project costs, which includes a factor for inflation. Superintendent Miklasz commented on the great work of the Facilities team and their efforts to build high quality facilities in the most cost-effective way possible. He noted with his project, the district is building what was initially promised to voters and will do it in the most cost-effective manner. Hell added her appreciation to the Facilities team and wants the district to make sure we are cognoscente of costs with this being one of the first large projects in the 2017 bond.\n\nRon Gallinat moved to approve that a construction contract be awarded to the low bidder, ZKG Contractors Inc., in the amount of $6,269,200.00.

Unanimous approval.\n\n**Reports**\n\n*Financial Update*\n\nRoy Burling reviewed the third quarter financial report in the board packet, and said the district is in a good position to carry funds forward into the next school year. Peggy Kinkade said she appreciated the level of detail provided in the report.\n\n*EL 9 – Technology Policy Monitoring Report*\n\nSuperintendent Miklasz reviewed the EL 9 report in the board packet and thanked Skip Offenbacher and Ben Hansen for their work and preparation. Offenbacher reviewed sections 1-3 of the report and noted the work of Bend-La Pine Online and the increase in support and courses offered to students during the school year and summer months. BLPO teachers are working with classroom teachers to help intervene and support struggling students and are seeing great success with efforts in preventing student from falling behind or failing. He noted that a big effort has been made this year to promote and introduce coding and computer science into classrooms; along with breaking down the misconceptions instruction coaches are giving teachers the ability and tools to teach these courses. Chair High asked about coding and being considered a second language. Offenbacher said he just discussed this topic in a cohort meeting today along with how coding does apply to various aspects of learning.\n\nOffenbacher noted continual efforts being made around digital citizenship and the best ways to deliver digital citizenship messages and instructions to students on a more regular basis. Peggy Kinkade asked about equitable access and asked for clarification on page 20; the third build under 2018 response; and if it should read “summer classes” for original AND credit recovery were offered during the summer of 2017 and will be offered again during summer 2018. Offenbacher said that nearly all curriculum, etc. on a student’s iPad can be accessed without internet service. He also noted ELL students are being supported and have an opportunity to earn credits with and ELL teacher provided to support them. He also agreed with Kinkade’s correction to the report, he meant to include the word ‘and.’ The correction will be noted in the EL 9 report.\n\nBen Hansen reviewed sections 4 – 6 of the report and highlighted new efforts the technology team has put into place across the district; 100% of the district is now using dark fiber and plans for the new schools are being made to have the same fiber connectivity. Hansen also addressed student data privacy and processes used by the district with all vendors to ensure data is protected. Kinkade asked how the district is reviewing and deciding to stay with iPads or move toward another type of device, or a combination of devices. Offenbacher said Chromebooks have been deemed by some schools for a variety of courses and at this point, the district continues to be iPad centric. He noted the district is open to looking at new device options as they become available and there is continual conversation about what is the best tool for students, teachers and programs."}

Gross domestic product is expected to grow by 0.3 % in real terms, which is a decisive slowdown compared to the previous year. A deceleration in production rates is expected, which would have a negative impact on the labour market, leading to an increase in the unemployment rate. The political situation at both national and international level is contributing negatively by creating uncertainty in the financial markets with negative consequences for the economy at global level. A negative economic situation makes its weight felt more in the disadvantaged areas, in the so-called smaller centres. Due to the lack of services, infrastructures and job offers, some parts of the territory are constantly being abandoned in favour of large metropolitan centres where we find greater opportunities for the new generations. In addition to the migration of the new generations to foreign countries, we should not underestimate the phenomenon of migration within the national territory, which is growing continuously as confirmed by the forecasts for future years. A shift in the weight of the population from the South to the Centre-North of the country is expected in the years to come. In 2005 the Centre-North would welcome 71% of residents against 66% of today; the South instead would welcome 29% against 34% at present.²\n\n**Exposure to risk and fragility of the territory**\n\nThe World Economic Forum recently published the fourteenth edition of the Global Risk Report, based on a survey of experts and decision-makers from various sectors of the global economy on the perception of risks at the international level. The main global risks remain linked to environmental issues, representing 5 of the top 10 global risks in terms of both probability of occurrence and impact; in particular, climate disasters are still the main risk in terms of probability.\n\nStarting from the analysis and study of risk is a choice dictated by the desire to take as a reference the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN Agenda 2030. Among the sustainability objectives of the Goal 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, the theme of environmental disasters emerges in Target 11.5 “Reducing the adverse effects of natural disasters. By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially reduce direct economic losses related to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with particular attention to the protection of the poor and people in vulnerable situations.\n\nGoing down to a national scale, the Italian territory is also at high environmental risk, at seismic and hydrogeological level. The risk is a danger that can be quantified through a probabilistic approach that relates the danger or the probability that a certain event produces damage, to the negative effects that such an event produces. It is of fundamental importance to consider the ability to respond to\n\n² Regional forecasts of the resident population in 2005. www.istat.it/it/files/2018/05/previsioni_demografiche.pdf"}

Regrettably, the extraordinary celebration of enlightenment science and its scientists has rendered professions that make things happen—artists, designers, engineers, managers, and agriculturalists—into practitioners of a craft, mere consumers of “pure” science, physics, for example. Herbert Simon (1969) sought to overcome the disparity of pure versus applied science by proposing a science of the artificial. Unfortunately, his proposal did not go far enough and did not manage to change this inequality. He defines design as an effort to improve a system—technological or social—but limited his concerns to rational, not human-centered choices among alternatives. I would cast the net for design more broadly and equate design, at least to start, with any effort to shape if not invent the affordances for new practices of living, forms of organization, and even languages to arise. Abstraction, by definition, are removed from everyday practices of living and can therefore easily mislead people into undesirable ventures and cognitive traps (Stolzenberg, 1984).\n\nThe cybernetician W. Ross Ashby (1956) adopted a less philosophically committed definition of cybernetics. While acknowledging the circularities that are inherent in numerous phenomena—from the realization of purpose to the emergence of self—he defined cybernetics as the study of all possible systems, which is informed by what cannot be built or evolve in nature. He thus put designers and observers on an equal footing and right into the domain that cybernetics is to explore. His definition also applied the very theory of information it advanced—reducing uncertainties by experiencing constraints on possibilities—to itself, here to systems that are imaginable but reveal themselves as unrealizable.\n\nMuch of Ashby’s work can be characterized as exploring the epistemological difference between synthesis and observation, between what can be designed and what can be learned from using a design without knowing its internal structure, intentions or origin. He took the notion of a “black box” that hides its makeup from its observer or experimenter as a metaphor for exploring brains, self-organizing systems, and large social phenomena such as the stock market. For example, he gave his students the task of figuring out the behavior of a non-trivial machine he had devised. As a machine, it was determinate, but its internal structure made it not obviously predictable from the relationship between its inputs, which the experimenter could set, and its outputs, which that experimenter could observe. The concept of a black box gave brain research a practical methodology as the interior of a working brain is hardly accessible and what one knows about cognition must be deduced from what the brain does. It also became a paradigm for social research, hoping that the complexities of social phenomena can be ignored in favor of overarching regularities. Ashby certainly cared for his use of language and always acknowledged the role of designers and experimenters (observers) of the systems he explored, but he never looked into the role of language and communication in conceptualizing the systems he studied.\n\nThe latter was introduced by the anthropologist Margaret Mead (1968), also a participant in the Macy Conference, who suggested that cyberneticians apply cybernetic principles to themselves, a suggestion that Heinz von Foerster (1974) coined “second-order cybernetics” and defined as the practice of including the observer in the observed. I prefer second-order cybernetics not to be limited to observers, spectators or theorists. As already mentioned, Ashby derived many cybernetic insights by exploring to the extent possible the dialectic between what"}

That is the LIBOR transition challenge facing many RMBS and other LIBOR-indexed asset-backed securities.\n\n**LIBOR Transition and LIBOR-Indexed Mortgage Notes**\n\nThe initial level of complication in the LIBOR transition occurs with the mortgage notes. It was common for mortgage notes to provide for LIBOR being unavailable, but that still makes LIBOR transition complicated, particularly for securitized loans.\n\nFirst, many lenders use the Fannie/Mae/FreddieMac standard note template, and that template contains LIBOR replacement language that commonly was used in mortgage notes. Even though most mortgage notes used the Fannie/Mae/FreddieMac LIBOR replacement language, at some point soon, trustees and servicers will have to analyze **every** mortgage note to make sure that they know, for **every** loan, how the interest rate on that loan will be affected by the end of LIBOR.\n\nThe question for investors (and homeowners, of course) is what to do if trustees and servicers forgo that expensive and time-consuming process and just work off the assumption that all notes use the LIBOR replacement language in the Fannie/Mae/FreddieMac standard note template.\n\nSecond, FannieMae/FreddieMac have adjusted their standard note template and policies to account for the LIBOR transition and, as of the end of 2020, no longer offer LIBOR-indexed products. Prior to that, however, the FannieMae/FreddieMac standard note format used this LIBOR definition and fallback language:\n\nThe “Index” is the average of interbank offered rates for one month U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (“LIBOR”), as published in The Wall Street Journal. The most recent Index figure available as of the date 15 days before each interest Rate Change Date is called the “Current Index”. If the Index is no longer available, the Note Holder will choose a new index that is based upon comparable information. The Note Holder will give notice of this choice. The Note Holder will deliver or mail to me [Borrower] a notice of any changes in the amount of my monthly payment before the effective date of any change.\n\nHere, once LIBOR ceases to be published, the trustee of the securitization trust, as the owner of the note, gets to “choose a new index that is based upon comparable information.” This is great for the trustee, perhaps not so much for the borrower. Even more, “comparable information” is a vague term that is sure to be the subject of litigation. There are legislative solutions (both adopted and proposed) to the problem of litigation over the trustee’s choice of a replacement rate that _does_ answer to this question. However, uncertainty—and hence substantial litigation risk—remains on the ultimate scope or effectiveness of those legislative solutions.\n\n**LIBOR-Indexed Payments to RMBS Investors**\n\nAs with individual mortgage notes, there is no standard LIBOR fallback language in securitization documents. Since there are many fewer RMBS securitization trusts than the many millions of mortgage notes, it should not be unduly burdensome for a trust to determine how it is supposed to pay investors if LIBOR no longer is available.\n\nThe definition of LIBOR in the pooling and servicing agreement for a typical RMBS securitization trust, ABBC 2006-OP11, explains what the trustee is to do if LIBOR is not available, offering a waterfall of choices based on the information is available to the trustee.\n\n“One-Month LIBOR”. With respect to each Interest Account Period, the rate determined by the Trustee on the related LIBOR Determination Date on the basis of the interbank offered rate for one-month United States dollar deposits in the London market as such rate appears on the Telerate Page 3750, as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such LIBOR Determination Date. If such rate does not appear on that page (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or if such service is no longer offered, another service for displaying One-Month LIBOR or comparable rates as selected by the Trustee) on a LIBOR Determination Date, One-Month LIBOR for the related Interest Accrual Period will be the Reference Bank Rate, determined by the Trustee as follows:\n\n(i) If on such LIBOR Determination Date two or more Reference Banks provide Reference Bank Rates, One-Month LIBOR for the related Interest Accrual Period shall be the arithmetic mean of such Reference Bank Rates (rounded upwards"}

The most influential works on slavery have properly focused on agricultural bondage and how it shaped slavery’s development and defined the majority of owner-slave relationships. A few historians, such as Richard Price, W. Jeffrey Bolster, David S. Cecelski, Michael Craton, and Thomas Buchanan, have studied maritime slavery, the work of enslaved people in sailing, fishing, and whaling. A handful of scholars have mentioned slaves as survivors, but there has been no sustained study of their recreational and occupational swimming and underwater diving. Although most bondage people were agricultural laborers, that did not preclude swimming. Most plantations were located near waterways to facilitate the transportation of slave-produced goods to market, and rice plantations throughout the Americas were typically situated on tidal waterways, which were vital to the irrigation of this crop. Thus, large numbers of plantation slaves had ready access to waters in which to swim.\n\nSince the mid-twentieth century, scholars have increasingly appreciated slaves’ ability to transmit African skills and practices to the Americas and have examined how cultural retentions shaped the development of both black and white sociocultural institutions.\n\n*Ports, as Reading Exercises for the Younger Children in the Schools and Families of the Confederate States* (Richmond, 1864, 20–21).

And here the banker is perfectly right. At the time each of our credit banks is split into two sections as previously outlined, all lending institutions should be required to gradually convert their obligations to the public into bond indebtedness. The public should recognize that it is not proper or sound for them to have the right to withdraw their savings on demand, or on 30 days' notice, when those savings have, in fact, been borrowed by others from the lending institutions for a much longer period than 30 days. It is not sound for the same person that it is physically impossible for a lending institution to pay all its depositors in 30 days. But it would be sound for a lending institution to sell its bonds and then make loans that would mature on or before the bonds matured. And I understand that Swiss banks make use of this principle to some extent -- as well as the British Building Societies in England (they are the equivalent of our Savings and Loan Associations).\n\nThe banker may then ask: \"What happens if everybody wants to sell these new savings bonds at the same time?\"\n\nBarried in the answer to this question is one of the most powerful arguments against credit banking -- as well as one of the most powerful arguments for reform. Variations in the volume of money-housing are inherent in and have a very disturbing effect upon a system of credit banking (the prime example being a bank panic). By converting our system of credit banking into a system of deposit banking and stabilizing the per-capita supply of dollars, we will have removed the basic cause of variations in the volume of money-housing.\n\nHowever, if for the sake of argument we assume that the public suddenly did wish to hoard money (by converting bonds into money), there would be a healthful counteracting force to prevent such action from reaching excessive proportions. The price of bank bonds would fall.\n\nNow contrast the two systems. Under credit banking, there is a justifiable reason for a periodic increase in the desire to hoard money, and there is no deterrent to a withdrawal of money from the banking system for hoarding purposes. Indeed, the justification for the desire to hoard -- as well as the actual hoarding itself -- is encouraged by the fact that hoarding will cause a contraction of bank credit and therefore an appreciation in the value of money.\n\nUnder the new system there is no justifiable reason for a periodic increase in the desire to hoard money. There is no reason to hoard money -- because the supply of money can't decrease, and therefore its value won't be increasing. However, if we should assume that an increase in the desire to hoard money should occur, there will be a natural deterrent that will operate to prevent the increase from becoming excessive.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that a bank bond would be a poor investment. It should be obvious that any commodity or security will fall in price if everybody holding it decides to sell it. Bank bonds, under the new system would certainly be one of the safest investments that a person could make. And if someone raises the question: \"Wouldn't it be safe to buy a government bond, whose price is maintained by the government?\" the answer is: \"No. If the price of a bond has to be maintained by the government, you can be sure that the value of that bond is decreasing.\" In other words, the public should be concerned about the future value of their investments -- not the future price of those investments. Too many innocent people have exchanged their hard-earned dollars for government bonds whose price was maintained by the government but whose value has steadily deteriorated because of the failure of our government to protect the value of our dollar by stabilizing our banking system.\n\nWhen it is realized that the conversion of our credit banks into deposit banks automatically reduces the national debt by about $60 billion (the amount of government bonds now held by the banking system), many people may think that a slightly-of-hand trick is being played. But there is nothing tricky about it. The banking system acquired those bonds by heavily creating imaginary deposits on their books to that amount. As a result of that creation of deposits, our price structure is not on a sound basis. By putting a 100% reserve behind demand deposits subject to check, we're merely accepting the situation the bankers have put us in, and stabilizing it so that it can't collapse. We would merely be putting money where it is supposed to be.\n\nIt is amusing to think that two of the main criticisms of a 100%-reserve population standard are directly contradictory -- even though often expressed by the same person! The same critic will call the plan \"inflationary\" one minute and then turn around and call it \"deflationary\" the next minute. You have already seen some examples of this. But if you bear in mind that no new purchasing power will be given to, nor will any be"}

At the end of 2010, cooperatives had an estimated number of 50,000 members, two of three members being employed and earning incomes of 6,500 Euros per member and about 10 thousand Euros per employee.\n\nCredit Unions\nCredit Unions (known in Romania under the name Case de Ajutor Reciproc Houses of Mutual Aid - CAR) are organisations of social economy, legally established as non-profit associations, and having the purpose of providing small interest loans to its members, especially for consumer needs, but also to support or cover special situations (i.e. funeral expenses, marriage costs etc). There are two main types of credit unions – of the employees - CARS Case de Ajutor Reciproc a Salariatilor (which now includes also self-employed persons) and of the retiree - CARP Case de Ajutor Reciproc a Pensionarilor, with two separate tasks that regulate them. The credit unions of the employees can only conduct credit related activities while those of the retired may engage in other services for their members.\n\nCARPs play a significant role in the development of associative feeling for ageing people, and they can be viable socio-economic alternatives for covering risks like exclusion from the credit market of people with low income, difficult access to health and proximity services for poor elderly people and support for poor people in difficult situations. In Romania, Pensioners' Credit Unions also provide access to certain types of social services, some CARPs being accredited for this purpose.\n\nCAR operates with its own funds, which, unlike cooperatives, are collective and indivisible, with no capital divided into distinct parts between members. Source of loans granted by credit unions is represented by the deposition of members into a personal account called \"social fund\", bearing interests, but which does not have a deposit account character. Credit unions are non-bank financial institutions, but they have not a status of institutions engaged in lending activities, on a professional basis. They are financial, but not credit institutions and the legal framework prohibits granting credit to legal entities and collecting deposits. They are required to be registered with National Bank of Romania Register, and their business is supervised by the Central Bank. Activity related to the work performed by the credit unions is exempt from taxes and fees.\n\nIn the NBR Register, at the end of 2010 were recorded 2983 credit unions, from which 203 Pensioners' Credit Unions (7% from total) and 2780 Employees' Credit Unions. The records of the National Association of Employees' Credit Unions (UNCARCS) included a number of 2083 credit unions belonging to UNCARCS at the end of 2010 (75%), the rest of 697 credit unions being affiliated to other federations, or no affiliated, and most of them belonging to the employees from military units, police or other structures of central administration.\n\nOne of the most remarkable issue regarding credit unions, it is that from all the associative forms of social economy they have the biggest number of members (around 3.2 million persons). A percentage of 36% from total pensioners and 16% from total employees were members in a credit union at the end of 2010 in Romania.\n\nSheltered workshops\nSheltered workshops are considered to be part of social economy, in particular those functioning in the framework of associations and foundations that thus meet the social economy' social enterprise criteria. They are in many ways similar to Work Integration Social Enterprises - WISE and as such have been also included in CIRCIE report 2012[17] for Romania case (under the name of authorized protected units).\n\nSheltered workshops, organizations with an important role in work integration of people with disabilities, are organizational forms very close to the model of work integration social enterprise. They are established, authorized and function according to the Law 448 / 6 December 2006 regarding the protection and the promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities. According to this law, sheltered workshops are independent organizations or sections with own management in organizations, which has at least 30% employees with disabilities working with individual labor contract in the total number of employees. Sheltered workshops are accessible to different legal forms (for profit companies,"}

Gender – Appropriate Services – Design treatment to address the unique needs of each gender.**\n\nFindings from the focus groups and staff interviews showed that the Christian County Juvenile Drug Court team has recognized the need for gender-appropriate services and has thereby initiated certain program characteristics to accommodate these differences. Inpatient treatment sessions are used to accommodate specific gender issues when necessary. By tailoring their approaches to gender-specific issues the team is able to develop appropriate relationships with each participant and deliver treatment that is beneficial to both males and females.\n\n**Strategy #10. Cultural Competence – Create policies and procedures that are responsive to cultural differences and train personnel to be culturally competent.**\n\nFindings from the participant observation, team interviews, and the focus group showed that the Christian County Juvenile Drug Court team has demonstrated cultural competence by sending team members to training conferences where cultural issues are taught. Team members also make efforts to learn about the participant’s background and interact with family members in order to gain an understanding of the youth’s culture. These actions reflect the team’s awareness of the importance of cultural issues, help strengthen relationships between the participant and the staff, and effectively address the needs of both the participant and the family.\n\n**Strategy #11. Focus on Strengths – Maintain a focus on the strengths of youth and their families during program planning and in every interaction between the court and those it serves.**\n\nFindings from the participant observation, focus group, and staff/team interviews showed that the Christian County Juvenile Drug Court team focuses on the individual strengths of each participant and their family throughout the duration of the Drug Court program. As part of the initial assessment (AIA), the Drug Court team includes a “Strengths Assessment” questionnaire, which helps the participant to concentrate on his/her accomplishments and successes. This approach begins the participant’s program with a strength-based perspective and prepares the participant to accept a more responsible role in the community. This strength-based approach also aids in creating bonds between the participant and his/her family and helps the family provide support to the child during the program.\n\n**Strategy #12. Family Engagement – Recognize and engage the family as a valued partner in all components of the program.**\n\nFindings from the focus group, participant observation, and staff/team interviews showed that the Christian County Juvenile Drug Court program recognizes the importance of family roles and support in the treatment of the juvenile participant. Members of the Drug Court team understand that family members can influence the juvenile to make important choices throughout the duration of the program. Therefore, the team makes every effort to engage the family in all components of the program. In the Christian County program parents or other family members are required to attend and participate in court sessions. Participants and their family are also required to attend family treatment sessions. The Drug Court team also uses the initial assessment and other tools to evaluate the role of each family member and the dynamics between the family and the participant. By involving the participant’s family members during the Drug Court program the participant’s progress is enhanced and the family relationship is strengthened.\n\n**Strategy #13.

Because team members stay in contact with school officials they can quickly address any issues that might arise in order to best meet the needs of the participant. Each participant is required to attend school or to work toward a GED. The Drug Court also works with community resources such as day treatment, continuing education, and workforce development in order to help participants with continuing educational and vocational needs."}

In the first bid book, however, it was noticeable that what the whole of Germany associated with Chemnitz during the application phase, i.e. from August 2018 onward, hardly played a role in the application, namely the riots of right-wing extremist and populists in August 2018. Nevertheless, Chemnitz presented an extensive application overall and demonstrated a good network of cultural actors in the city and the region, so that the selection panel recommended the city for the next round.\n\nDresden (dropped out of competition in 2019)\nUnder the motto “New Home Dresden” (“Neue Heimat Dresden”), the Saxon capital presented concepts and projects in its bid book that were intended to counteract the social division of the city. In numerous artistic actions, some of which were supported by the project office with microcredits, as well as in panel discussions and participative projects such as a postcard campaign, the concept of “home” (“Heimat”) was played with in order to find new narratives for the city. This was not only about an open attitude towards immigrants, but also about major present and future tasks that fundamentally change people’s lives, such as digitisation. Although Dresden’s approach was highly innovative, relevant and authentic, various influential opinion makers such as the German Cultural Council (Deutscher Kulturad 2019: 14) and the Süddeutsche Zeitung (Heidemann’ Nürz 2019: online) contrasted the two Saxon competing cities in a questionably simplistic way: poor Chemnitz, which is preceded by a problematic reputation, versus dazzling, privileged Dresden. Whether Dresden really dropped out of the competition at an early stage against the background of this simplistic black-and-white portrayal in the media cannot be proven. In any case, many could not understand the selection panel’s assessment (see the Expert Panel’s Report of the Pre-Selection Stage / Selection of the European Capital of Culture 2025 in Germany, https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/actions/capitals-culture_en, and a comment at Jacobsen 2020: 22).\n\nGera (dropped out of competition in 2019)\nThe Thuringian city with only 95,000 inhabitants dared to go off the beaten track. An association of committed citizens initiated the application and pushed it forward years before the city made a relatively modest - contribution to the application. Their bid book 1 presented the historical heritage, and perhaps this common understanding of the interpretation of the past was already a benefit to the city society. However, too few feasible visions of the future were presented, which could be achieved with the ECoC title. All in all, Gera had probably shown too little commitment in the application process to meet the demanding and far-reaching requirements, especially with regard to the other top-class competing cities.\n\nHanover\nThe capital of Lower Saxony entered the competition relatively late and then immediately faced special cultural policy challenges: a new mayor was elected during this period, and there was also a change in the cultural administration after a few squabbles, when the former head of the culture department was brought to court. Nevertheless, Hanover managed to submit an exceptionally artistic bid book 1, which was awarded a prize not least for its design. Positive aspects of the content were its distinct European dimension and a professionally positioned management, which led to the expectation that the ECoC programme would be very feasible in the fair and Expo city."}

Without Judith, our personal capacity to listen would be diminished, and the injustice experienced by those not being heard would continue. Judith was not the only coach for better listening, but she was at her best as a formidable force to improve our hearing.\n\n**Judith’s School for Personal Assistants and Living Fully**\n\nOver the years, Judith had approximately 600 personal care assistants who were in fact recipients of one of the world’s most remarkable, entirely personal mentoring programs. Judith trained these 600 workers to manage her personal and career needs and to travel with her throughout the world. This experience helped Judith forge ideas about the essence of person-centered support and, in turn, offered her assistants a master class on how to live and participate fully in life.\n\nHer assistants came from a variety of cultural, social, and economic backgrounds, and they would go on to become artists, academics, entrepreneurs, social workers and much, much more—carrying with them Judith’s lesson to listen to your dreams.\n\nJudith supported this by listening to the inner workings of each assistant and tailored her instruction and their work assignments to help each of them to become the most remarkable person he or she could be. No one who worked for Judith escaped her grasp. All 600 of them were transformed. Some of them say that being Judith’s personal assistant saved their lives.\n\n**Dreaming**\n\nJudith’s now famous story about wanting to be a truck driver (even though she had no physical control of her arms or legs) has allowed many of us to learn to listen between the lines for deeper meaning. Her courage to finally reveal her own outrageous dream and then unpack it so we could understand qualities her as a great teacher. She convinced us of the obvious that our dreams contain the seeds of the directions for our lives. The trick is that we have to listen for them and be willing to hear differently. Because so many of us have come to understand what is under Judith’s truck driver metaphor, the dreams of so many other individuals and families have been heard and honored. Bigger lives have been lived and expanded upon, all because of a dream.\n\n**Laser Eagles Art Guild**\n\nEarly in life, Judith painted in art therapy. She loved it but was told it was not art! The artist in her was sealed shut for decades, until she rediscovered it when she encountered and then reinvented painting with a “tracker”—a person who holds the brush for you but implements your artistic vision on canvas. For Judith, it was liberating, but because it was Judith, it also became a movement that now allows thousands who have mobility and communication struggles to reveal their own creative abilities and expression. It was a simple idea: artists using lasers to guide trackers to create art. Laser Eagles and its derivatives were born. In her unstoppable fashion, Judith was collaborating with a team of engineers and artists to invent new technologies to allow more people with mobility and community struggles to be artists through the use of iPads and beyond. Still in the refinement stages, these will be incredible legacies of creating a process where folks with few choices are genuinely in control of expressing themselves through art. Yet, another group of people are connected to Judith.\n\n**Limits? What’s That?**\n\nPerhaps some of the most outrageous and inspirational undertakings were born of someone saying, “You can’t” to Judith. She traveled the world, ate and drank with the best, hot tubbed and swam everywhere, canceled many times, and climbed the rock wall on a cruise ship because it was there. When she was told, “You can’t do that,” she made a point of doing it. She became an actor, starring in two plays and several"}

For continued reliance, 2520.104b-31(d)(4) requires an annual notice of “internet” availability be furnished “electronically” to “the address” described in the “covered individual” definition. Further, Footnote 60 states that the proposed safe harbor would, if adopted “supersede the relevant portions of FAB 2006-03.”¹⁰\n\n“Internet” - With respect to the provision s use of the term “internet,” while the “internet” may be the infrastructure by which information is electronically transmitted and received, that term may be viewed as limiting. The information could be conveyed and accessible through a web-based application on a smartphone or other connected device that permits the user to access information without the need to access a website via a web browser. We recommend the final rule include more flexible language regarding the electronic medium or mediums by which the “covered individual” can access the information.\n\n“Field Assistance Bulletin 2006-3” - With respect to the requirements associated with both the initial and subsequent Notice of Internet Availability, we recommend additional flexibility for plan administrators. Field Assistance Bulletin (“FAB”) 2006-3 permits the furnishing of such a notice in a manner permitted under Internal Revenue Code section 1.401(a)-21 (“Treasury Regulation”). For ACLI members that provide administrative services to ERISA plans, many of their plan sponsor customers rely on FAB 2006-3 for the furnishing of quarterly plan benefit statements. We note that a paper approach prescribed for the initial notice is one of the approaches permitted under the Treasury Regulation. In addition to paper, the Treasury Regulation permits such notices to be made electronically when the electronic medium used to provide the notice is a medium that the recipient has the effective ability to access. The Proposed Rule should be amended to permit plan administrators the option to provide an initial notice or subsequent notices either electronically or on paper.\n\nThe guidance set forth in FAB 2006-03 and in the proposal at paragraph (g) is reasonable and has been used for more than a decade. We are not aware of any controversy regarding its use or any adverse impact on plan participants. For many plan sponsors, a shift to a paper approach for initial notices or an electronic only approach for subsequent notices will come at a cost. If the Department determines not to amend section 2520.104b-31(d)(4) to provide such additional flexibility, we urge the Department to provide at least two years from the effective date of any supersession of prior disclosure-related guidance during which plan sponsors and service providers may rely on the prior guidance to provide time to make any necessary changes to administrative systems.\n\n“Multiple Electronic Addresses” - With respect to the phrase “the address,” while it is possible that a plan administrator will have but one electronic address for a covered individual, they may have more than one.

A shareholder giving a proxy can strike out the names of the nominees printed in the accompanying form of proxy and insert the name of another nominee in the space provided, or the shareholder may complete another form of proxy. A proxy nominee need not be a shareholder of the Corporation. A shareholder giving a proxy has the right to attend the Meeting or appoint someone else to attend as his or her proxy at the Meeting and the proxy submitted earlier can be revoked in the manner described under “Appointment and Revocation of Proxies”.\n\nNon-registered Holders\n\nIn many cases, Common Shares beneficially owned by a holder (a “Non-Registered Holder”) are registered either:\n\n(a) in the name of an intermediary that the Non-Registered Holder deals with in respect of the Common Shares. Intermediaries include banks, trust companies, securities dealers or brokers, and trustees or administrators of self-administered RRSPs, RRIFs, RESPs and similar plans; or,\n\n(b) in the name of a depository (such as The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited or “CDS”). Non-Registered Holders do not appear on the list of shareholders of the Corporation maintained by the transfer agent.\n\nIn accordance with Canadian securities law, the Corporation has distributed copies of the Notice of Meeting, this Management Information Circular and the form of proxy (collectively, the “meeting materials”) to CDS and intermediaries for onward distribution to Non-Registered Holders.\n\nIntermediaries are required to forward meeting materials to Non-Registered Holders unless a Non-Registered Holder has waived the right to receive them. Typically, intermediaries will use a service company to forward the meeting materials to Non-Registered Holders. Non-Registered Holders, other than NOBOs, will receive either a voting instruction form or, less frequently, a form of proxy. The purpose of these forms is to permit Non-Registered Holders to direct the voting of the Common Shares they beneficially own. Non-Registered Holders should follow the procedures set out below, depending on which type of form they receive."}

Children in SCHIP are enrolled in a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) product, currently managed by Anthem, that includes traditional HMO elements like PCPs. The population represented in the CHIS commercial data is a mixture of Preferred Provider Organizations (26%), HMO (52%), Point-of-Service (12%), and Indemnity (10%).\n\n**Interpretation of Results and Limitations**\n\nThis is a study of children covered by three different types of health plans (Medicaid, SCHIP, and NH CHIS commercial) conducted in New Hampshire. The large number of covered members studied lends credibility to the findings. However, a number of cautions about the data used and results of this study are provided.\n\nThis study was based on administrative eligibility and claims data. Differences in provider or insurer claims coding, data processing, or reimbursement arrangements may contribute to the variances shown in this report. Differences in benefit packages and coding by NH CHIS commercial insurer products (Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO), HMO), Point-of-Service, Indemnity or \"Third Party Administrator\" (TPA) may also contribute to variances shown in this report. Because of potential for negative bias (reduced rates) in the NH CHIS commercial insurance estimates, children enrolled in Indemnity and TPA plans (13% of children in the NH CHIS commercial data) were excluded from the claims-based HEDIS measures reported. Children enrolled in NH CHIS commercial Indemnity and TPA plans were included in all non-HEDIS sections of the report.\n\nThe New Hampshire CHIS commercial population contains information on those residents whose claims are included in the NH CHIS database, which generally only includes members whose policies were purchased in New Hampshire. Areas close to the borders of New Hampshire may be less well represented than areas in the interior. Additionally, companies that self-fund their health care and do not use a TPA to pay claims are not captured in the data set. Because of these two factors, this report underestimates the number of children covered by NH CHIS commercial insurance in New Hampshire.¹\n\nWhile it may be of interest to evaluate children who migrate between the Medicaid, SCHIP, and NH CHIS commercial insurance plan types, there were limitations in the ability to track children who changed insurance plans or insurance plan types during the year. A NH CHIS study was completed in 2009 to track migration between plan types during a three year period, especially with regard to disenrollment and reenrollment in Medicaid and provides insight into patterns of enrollment and disenrollment.²³\n\nThis study compared insured populations that were very different from each other. Previous NH CHIS annual reports on children were limited in the evaluation of health status, which is a complex process. The data set was limited to the number of children who were in the Medicaid risk grouping (CRG). Utilization and payment rates in this report are standardized for population differences in health status and age were added for this SFY2008 version of the annual report on children's health insurance and have been updated with SFY2009 data for this report.\n\n¹ The statute requiring submission of data is limited to areas regulated by the NH Department of Insurance.\n\n**Children's Health Insurance Programs in New Hampshire, SFY2009**\n\n**Office of Medicaid Business and Policy, NH Department of Health and Human Services, October 2010**"}

They thus, in effect, borrow gold, and recoup themselves by being able to lend, on profitable terms, larger amounts than they borrow, since they can always create credit to larger amounts than that of the gold in their vaults. Sometimes, in fact, in times of pressure banks find themselves obliged to import gold so as to strengthen their position, whatever the loss on exchange may be.\" (p. 161-162) (talks added)\n\nWhat Withers has pointed out is that movements of gold are so productive of changes in speculative markets resulting from changes in credit conditions, that there are some people engaged in moving gold from country to country solely for this reason, i.e., to take advantage of the market changes they know will occur as a result of the gold increments.\n\nOf course we should bear in mind that it isn't the gold standard as such that results in these abuses -- but rather our yearning of credit on gold. These disturbances would not occur if all countries had kept their paper money (notes and checks) fully representative of gold.\n\nLet us now consider some of the political consequences of this system of banking. One of the most significant political results of the international gold-credit system's impetus it gave to various plans for internationalism. The project functioning of the gold-credit mechanisms requires that each country abide by \"the rules of the game.\" The rules are simple enough: Expand credit when gold is flowing in; contract credit when gold is flowing out; and let these expansions and contractions of credit have their full effect upon prices and wages.\n\nHowever, everybody bakes at playing according to the rules. We don't like to have prices and wages rising and falling just because certain individuals are moving gold into or out of our country. Nevertheless, we reckon to abide by the rules is what causes the gold standard to break down completely. We then have an era of \"pegged\" exchanges and control that stifle the free movement of goods and services between countries. The logical solution to this problem, according to the gold-standardist, is to have closer cooperation between all countries -- closer cooperation on monetary matters, that is -- so that the game is played according to the rules by all participants. A powerful drive toward \"internationalism\" in one form or another is therefore a logical result of the gold-credit mechanism.\n\nConsider now what happens if one country decides that it would rather not play the game and would prefer to cut itself loose from gold altogether and stabilize its own internal economy once and for all. From the standpoint of the citizens of that country, that would be a most worthwhile objective. But from the standpoint of those who wish to have their giants \"confidence game\" contract -- and we must, of necessity, include all those sincere people who can comprehend no other way of achieving international equilibrium -- the country that bakes and tries to withdraw from the game must be brought into line. The result is constant friction between the countries concerned. More of this later.\n\nNow let us consider some of the internal political consequences of this system of banking. Naturally, those who understood it and were profiting thereby, made every effort to perpetuate the system. That was to be expected. They made full use of the press and the educational system itself to keep the public in ignorance of what was going on. They successfully convinced the public that loans and depressions were caused by a free enterprise system rather than the banking system. They successfully bashed up any man -- or his writings -- that showed the correct cause of the trouble. This does not mean that books condemning credit banking were not published. They were. But they didn't get used as textbooks in schools and universities. So naturally, generation after generation of people grew up in total ignorance of the vicious system they lived under -- wondering why there was so much injustice and wrong, why there went no better, so much injustice seemed to result from freedom. For a more detailed analysis of the extent to which the history taught in English schools was deliberately distorted, I can highly recommend The Two Nations by Christopher Hollis.\n\nToday, of course, there are no \"villains.\" At least we don't need to worry about them if there are. For the greatest amount of trouble which is caused by the mmy web-earning, web-introduction, and scarce people who have been and raised, and educated, in such a way that they accept our system of credit banking as a normal, natural, and sound development. They accept our periodic depressions as being signs of \"excesses\" in business, poor management, or some other pet theory that magnifies out of all proportion some slight weakness that exists in a free enterprise economy. These people look upon the speculative in foreign exchange as a man who helps to maintain equilibrium by anticipating gold movements and thereby bringing about an"}

Tear’s recording setup is totally wired with Monster, from the microphones through the console (internally rewired with Monster intercom) to the speakers. The weekend trip included a Saturday evening concert at a Sunday taping session. Since it was Halloween weekend, all the music was associated with Death, Mususwyk’s Night on Bald Mountain, the cave scene from Grieg’s Peer Gynt. The Saint-Saens funeral march that served as the theme of Alfred Hitchcock’s TV show, etc.\n\nThe bass drum was quite modest in size, smaller than the one the BSO was, but its sound was a prominent in the hall as it is in Tear’s recording. The halls sound is warm and bass-heavy, and the stage shell acts as a giant megaphone. Tear’s principal bass contribution seems to be to precise placement and orientation of the bass drum at stage center to ensure that stage-area reflections reinforce rather than cancel its output. The drum was hit on its rear diaphragm, functioning positive-pressure waves into the hall. (When a bass drum is struck on the front, much of the initial reverberation is a refraction.)\n\nAnother-wise, the hall is a bit too dead with an audience but is virtually dead for recording when empty. Music Hall has heavily populated streets with a soft, absorbent exterior; consequently the acoustics, unlike Boston’s Symphony Hall and Sanders Theater, don’t become excessively live when the audience goes home. Jack Renner and conductor Erich Kunzel credit the hall’s acoustics for the success of their recordings, and Tear’s wants to install a permanent monitoring room in Cincinnati’s Music Hall for use with recording projects other than the Pops.\n\nThe orchestra was recorded with three omnidirectional mikes on tall stands at the lip of the stage (surprisingly close to the front of the orchestra), plus two ambience mikes on very tall stands in the cross-sills, halfway back in the hall. For pop repertoire the main mikes are mounted relatively low and close, eight or nine feet above the stage floor and just behind the conductor, to enhance detail. For all-classical repertoire they are moved a foot higher and a few inches farther away, to achieve a more blended sound. Pops mikes may be added to during exit curtain instruments in some movie/TV music. For recent recordings with choruses (e.g. The Sound of Music), the chorus was placed in audience seats, just behind the main mikes, so no accent mikes were needed for the chorus. Renner agrees that some of his European recordings, especially in England, are too reverberant and diffuse; the halls had so much reverb that they couldn’t be tamed. (Those halls work better with the cardioid and figure-eight mikes that British engineers favor.)\n\nThe monitoring room was a converted l Audio Lounge, about twice the size of a typical living room (and with double the ceiling height). ADS 1530 speakers were located a foot or two from the front wall, with ASC Tube Traps standing in the front corners. Absorptive panels were mounted between the speakers and on the side walls to kill reflections. A six-foot tall array of RPG diffusers spanned the width of the room behind the engineers, a few feet in front of the back wall. The digital processors and whirring VTRs were installed behind the wall of diffusion. They included a Soundstream, a Sony PCM-1630 with UMatix VCR, a PCM-F1 with Beta, and an experimental machine. The F1 ate has actually been used in several recordings when both the main and backup tapes failed. (And after successful tying the Colossus digital recorder into Tear, Tear’s critical t server more time than it would be from somewhere remote.)\n\nEngineer Jack Renner is responsible for the entire setup; the jeni has to improvise during recording, while producer Bob Woods and conductor Kunzel make all decisions on rektakes. Renner and editor Elaine Martone monitored via speakers to judge overall balance and pacing, while Woods monitored via Sony headphones to detect tiny performance flaws. The most of the recording first vime pictures were used, and the rear ambience were mixed in at a very low level. The only change during the music was an occasional slight tweaking of the left-channel level and a frequency jump EQ (to keep visuals from being drowned out during heavy brass passages). How good was the sound? Like a very good hit-1 system; it did not have the magically “real” feeling that its sometimes obtained with a state-of-the-art amplitude system. Traditionally it has been assumed that recording engineers hear their recordings better than consumers do, but the opposite is more and more the case.\n\nMost of the Pops sessions, activities as TV scores and relatively brief classical items, were recorded in one or two takes apiece. Complete classical material like Mususwyk’s Night on Bald Mountain took about 40 takes, many in the difficult section near the end where instruments enter in pairs and Woods wanted exact intonation and ensemble timing for each entry. Lots of work will be done on a digital editor by Elaine Martone to put this recording into final shape.\n\n— Peter Mitchell (California)\n\nDecember 1988\nBAS Meeting\n\nDavid Moran called the meeting to order at the Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge with a welcome to several newcomers. The presentation planned for the evening: a new subwoofer design by Poh Ser Hsu (with a pair of the 2500s used as satellites).\n\ndb is not completely going out of business, by the way: the consumer, speaker, and pro lines will continue. The OEM consumer business has been sold (since this meeting) to THAT Corporation (named for the principals, who are Les Tyler, Gary Hebert, and Paul Travaline), and the sale of pro to AGX (less the RTA-1!) is inching toward completion.\n\nPage 8"}

Several studies have noted that brain size is correlated with an enlargement of both subdivisions of the SVZ and with increased numbers of IPCs. In particular, the gyrification index of a wide array of species has been linked to the size of the bRGC population (Fietz et al. 2010; Hansen et al. 2010). While species with a lifespanable cortex contain bRGCs, and some (e.g., marmoset) even develop a distinct osVZ compartment (Garcia-Moreno et al. 2012; Kelava et al. 2012), the numbers of bRGCs within these brains are reduced relative to gyrencephalic species. Nonetheless, how bRGCs contribute on a macro scale to cortical formation is still at a theoretical stage. For instance, the human brain has expanded more in the latter dimension than in the radial dimension (thickness) and it is unclear how and whether bRGCs lead to a preferential increase surface area rather than thickness. Because of these unanswered questions, a primary mechanism driving species-specific differences in brain growth remains the expansion of the founder cell population prior to the onset of neurogenesis (Figure 2.1). Taken together, differences in brain size across the phylogenetic tree are likely due to the synergistic effects of a larger founder cell population and species-specific differences in the composition of the IPC pool as well as changes in the total neuronal output per precursor type.\n\nA second role for the precursor heterogeneity in brain development may be that it contributes directly to neuronal diversity. The classes of excitatory neurons which comprise the six layers of the neocortex have been characterized by their birth date, molecular expression, electrophysiology, and target-specific projections. Clonal analysis by genetic fate-mapping has shown that individual aRGCs can produce neurons that span all of the neocortical layers, suggesting that aRGCs may be progressively tuned over developmental time to generate different types of excitatory neurons. Transplantation experiments indicate that isolated aRGCs generate neuron types appropriate for their birth date, even when placed in a heterochronic environment (McConnell and Kaznowski 1991), further supporting the notion that aRGCs undergo temporal fate restriction. Another assumption contained within this progressive fate restriction model is that aRGCs of any given developmental age are all identical, but in vivo evidence for this assumption is thus far unconvincing. It is also important to note that the molecular mechanisms underlying this temporal fate restriction have not yet been identified. Nevertheless, while this model may explain a primary mechanism for producing the different neuronal cell types across neocortical layers, it does not describe a method for generating different types of neurons within each layer.\n\nMorphological and electrophysiological studies have defined distinct intralaminar populations of excitatory cells and shown that intralaminar diversity differs across areas. At any given time during the neurogenic interval, neurons are contemporaneously produced directly from aRGCs as well as indirectly from multiple classes of IPCs. As shown from birth-dating studies, these neurons are destined for the same neocortical layer, and mouse studies have\n\nFrom “The Neocortex,” edited by W. Singer, T. J. Sejnowski and P. Rakic.

I begin by discussing dimensions of modeling in this context and consider the question of whether robotic models are necessary for modeling behavior. Robotic models are a type of simulation model, but do they do anything that computer simulation models do not do? One reason often cited is that many physical variables influence the behavior of a physical system and it is difficult if not practically impossible to represent all of these with adequate laws or rules for physical interactions in a computer simulation. Another, and perhaps more important reason, is that the process of designing, building, and testing robotic models leads to new problems, discoveries, and interpretations precisely because one is working with a physical model. To illustrate this point, I will discuss examples and results of modeling individual and groups of rat pups with robotic models.\n\nThe Cantor Dust of Conflict\n\nMeg Spohn, University of Denver, Denver, CO\n\nSCTPLS Annual Conference August, 2005: 22 From the classic Cantor Dust, we understand that noise in data transmission tends to scale in a precise pattern. As described by Gleick in his classic book, a common representation of the Cantor Dust is a representation of a transmission with noise in, for example, its middle third, in a scaled iteration down to the bits. Similarly, the intensity of human conflict, as measured by battle deaths over time series, seems to follow scaling patterns not unlike the Cantor Dust, with its own pattern of terrible bursts and terrible silence. War is often described by the soldiers who were there as being composed of short periods of intense violent conflict interspersed with longer periods of quiet tension or tedium. This project examines these patterns, and considers some of the questions that must necessarily accompany accompanying them: What is descriptive pattern, what are the risks inherent in forecasting, ethical, philosophical, and otherwise? What are the human and policy implications of potentially using such a pattern, or of allowing it to be used?\n\nNonlinear Hypothesis in Education Research Methodology\n\nDimitrios Stamovlasis, Education Research Center, Ministry of Education, Athens, Greece\n\nThe rapid changes of today's world present new challenges on our educational system. Education research dealing with a complex and continuously changing system may not be able to provide the proper support by implementing conventional linear, qualitative or quantitative, approaches. NDS theory and the science of complexity might provide more solid foundation for understanding and decision-making. The present work explores the application and the usefulness of Catastrophe Theory for testing nonlinear hypotheses in educational research. Quick adaptable models are proposed, which accounts for discontinuities in students' performance. These models implement psychometric variables from neo- Piagetian theories or information processing models, as controls and demonstrate nonlinear interactions between students' mental resources and mental tasks. In addition, such catastrophe is tested in others education research areas implementing other behavioral variables such as students' attitudes and choices, or teachers' selection in workforce recruitment. Measurement were taken at two points in time, and the data analysis involved dynamic difference equations and statistical regression techniques. The nonlinear models proved to be superior to the linear counterparts, and that shows the limitations of statistical modeling used so far in education. Utilizing nonlinear methods and making the paradigm shift realized in behavioral science, seems promising for educational and pedagogy. This work demonstrates the feasibility of providing empirical evidences for nonlinear processes in education research, which will build bridges between NDS-theory concepts and pedagogical theories.\n\nThe Multidimensionality of Health: Tools, One to Estimate the Status of Health and Another One to Evaluate Therapeutic Goals\n\nKarl Tolli, Neuropsychiatric clinic, Medical University of Vienna\n\nBased on a definition on illness and health, Which includes both individual bio-psycho-social complexity and dynamics of development, two tools will be presented, which are developed to be used in daily clinical practice.

We observed and recorded 11 routine deep brain stimulation (DBS) programming appointments. We found an overall lack of health literacy surrounding DBS as well as a lack of digital literacy in patients’ ability to use their DBS Patient Programme to modify their DBS settings. These two factors led to patient disease of their programming device outside of the clinical setting. This paper’s contribution is to present this relationship and suggest ways we can better facilitate patients in gaining both health and digital literacy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nA turn towards a patient-centered care model has prompted an interest in providing patients with devices to monitor their health, adjust treatments accordingly, and share this data with their clinicians. In essence, putting power in the patient’s hand to give them agency over their own care. However, the context around the use usage could be a significant factor in evaluating the efficacy of these devices in actually achieving patient engagement or empowerment. Most significant in this regard is the importance of health literacy and numeracy in understanding one’s disease and the relationship between symptoms and treatment [1]. In addition, as further technologicality advanced devices are developed, a patient’s ability to understand and use the technology plays a greater role in patient engagement [2].\n\nIn the following study, we describe the particular case of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptom management. In this instance, patients are provided with a device to modify the brain stimulation parameters to better address symptoms throughout the day. As we show in our findings, low health literacy and digital literacy often limit and occasionally altogether deter patients from modifying their stimulation device parameters outside of the clinical setting. This presents a real challenge in (1) presenting patients with health devices to maintain control over their own quality of life and (2) engaging patients in guiding clinicians in making further treatment changes that provide therapeutic benefit. Our findings lead us to make design recommendations for the development of visualizations to explicate the relationship between DBS adjustments and symptomatic outcomes in order to facilitate patient engagement through increased health literacy and digital literacy.\n\nBackground\n\nThere has been a shift from the traditional clinical care model, where clinicians are solely in charge of the care of the patient, to a patient-centered care model that is more focused on patients being engaged in their own medical decision-making and treatment [3]. Patient engagement has been associated with a decreased number of annual visits for specialty care and fewer hospitalizations and diagnostic tests [4].\n\nPrior work has shown that health literacy is important for patient engagement as patients can then better manage their health, make more informed decisions, and increase communication with their doctors [1]. Health literacy allows chronically and progressively ill patients to better “obtain, process, and understand” their health conditions and assess them in making more informed decisions surrounding their care [5]. With low health literacy, patients often lack the skills to effectively communicate important information, such as symptoms or other health concerns, to their doctors, and they frequently feel that their physicians fail to explain health related information in a manner that they can understand [6]. This, in turn, can lead to poor compliance when it comes to taking medications or following a treatment plan, and as a result, worse health outcomes [6].\n\nLikewise, digital literacy, the ability to appropriately use digital tools to access and manage digital resources [7], has also been shown to be a fundamental factor in patient engagement primarily with regards to searching for online health information [2]. For instance, in a 2013 study examining the relationship between functional health literacy, self-efficacy, social support, and empowerment in individuals living with Parkinson’s, nearly 50% of patients indicated that the Internet was the most common source they used to find health information relating to their disease [8]."}

While Robert Walsh was traversing Brazil in the 1820s, he concluded that most slaves could swim, dubbing them “amphibious.” Francis Fedric, who was enslaved in Virginia and Kentucky during the mid-1800s, contended that most bondage people could swim, saying “unlike most slaves, I never learned to swim.”\n\nIn the American South standards of modesty probably prevented adult bondwomen from swimming. Caribbean and Latin American slaves maintained many West African customs and mores, most lived in relative isolation from whites, and the year-round heat kept the majority from wearing much clothing. Consequently, bondwomen there, like their African counterparts, probably faced little stigma when they swam nude. Stedman penned several accounts of male and female bondagepeople swimming together nude without being thought immodest or immoral. Likewise, Richard Ligon detailed the swimming prowess of the nude Barbadian bondwoman who captured a duck. Even though slavery placed American bondwomen, who performed much the same work as bondmen, outside southern gender conventions, white and black society still encouraged and forced them to conform to many of those conventions. Female slaves themselves may have internalized southern mores. Thus, while enslaved female children may have disrobed to swim or play in the water, once a female slave reached puberty, black and white southerners would have viewed such actions as immodest. As bondwomen entered adolescence, they probably felt that swimming was no longer an acceptable activity.\n\nIn Born in Bondage, the historian Marie Jenkins Schwartz asserted that slaveholders did not encourage their slaves to learn to swim because they felt swimming did not increase slaves’ economic value, aided them in escaping, and might lead to drowning and the loss of valuable human property. Indeed, many slaves incorporated swimming into their repertoires of resistance. But swimming could increase a bondman’s usefulness and monetary worth, and some slaveholders encouraged it.⁵⁶\n\n---\n\n¹ Lignan, *True and Exact History of the Island of Barbadoes*, 52; Stedman, *Narrative of Five Year’s Expedition Against the Renowned Negroes of Surinam*, 7–8, 57, 88, 154, 157–58, 164, 192, 214; Robert Walsh, *Notice of Brazil in 1828 and 1829* (2 vols., Boston, 1831), 1, 281; Francis Fedric, *Slave Life in Virginia and Kentucky* (London, 1863), 1, 281.\n\n² Greenwich Middle Hall, *Social and Civil Law on Plantation Societies: A Comparative Study of Dominique and Cabo (1957)*.

Following further data releases and updates, the clusters assessment revealed ten traded clusters, two localized clusters, and four opportunity clusters (shown above). Opportunity clusters represent those industries which do not currently exist within our economic landscape but for which we have a strong concentration of workers and suppliers.\\(^{32}\\)\n\nTo demonstrate the inter-related nature of clusters and industries - automotive and advanced manufacturing are two of the largest clusters in the region, both of which caused the metals and plastics manufacturing industries to grow. These four industries have spurred the growth of the transportation, distribution & logistics industry. While downstream, chemical manufacturing has also grown in the region, the advent and increase of advanced manufacturing has spurred growth in this cluster and presents opportunities for further growth. The presence of both industrial and occupational specializations in these clusters lends itself well to create a medical device manufacturing cluster in Middle Tennessee that could rival the Memphis region. This also gives rise to opportunities for industries engaged in production technology. The complementary nature of the occupations and skills that make up these industries both in the economic region and among our peer communities allow policymakers and business leaders to consider workforce development efforts that ensure secondary operations for industries. These secondary operations would allow industries to retool or shift their operations to complementary operations that allow them to respond to market disruptions, recessions, or events such as war or global pandemics that alter or disrupt supply lines.\\(^{33}\\)\n\nThe economic region also continues to perform well in business services. Davidson and Williamson Counties have seen increases in business services involving the management of companies or headquarters. Additionally, insurance and captive insurance firms (companies that manage risk for other companies or their own subsidiaries) have seen significant growth thanks in part to a strong push by the State of Tennessee to tailor a regulatory framework more conducive to the growth and recruitment of captive firms.\\(^{34}\\) The increase of the local health-related cluster has also underpinned the growth in insurance related industries. Between these business clusters and the insurance industries, the opportunity exists to develop a highly specialized information technology cluster.\n\nTo determine these clusters, and map out the top occupational specializations for each, the North American Industry Classification System was utilized to align to each cluster with its respective growth sector. The table below identifies the industries having the strongest specializations in terms of industry and occupational specialization. Some clusters and industries were excluded as they represent lower regional wages\\(^{35}\\), required unskilled workers and were highly susceptible to economic disruptions.

Shon, twenty-nine, and Dred, twenty-five, have a wide range of performances; while Dred’s signature act is a mackadaddy from the disco era, Shon is stunning as a hot, crotch-grabbing rapper (fig. 3). Shon and Dred both won HerShe Bar contests and went on to compete in the final showdown against each other. Shon remembers seeing Dred in an early contest: “I said she’s definitely gonna win, she’s got it! She was excellent. I liked the name, I liked the presence, and I could tell she was good. As a performer myself, I always look for true dramatic talent.” Dred thinks Shon is a “smooth” drag king, and she remembers seeing Shon as her major competition in the Grand Finale contest, ultimately, the contest came down to the two of them, and it was Dred who walked away with the title. In the earlier contest that she won, Shon recalls that she was asked to answer a question on stage. The question was “What does it mean to you to be a drag king?” And Shon answered, “It means showing men and women more women should be treated.” This answer is very much in keeping with Shon’s smooth drag king persona, and it won her plenty of fan support. Shon noticed that more women of color entered the contests as time went on, but she also noted that many of these women did not dress up in drag: “They went up with what they had, rather than in drag; they might be boyish naturally or just bitch-looking.”\n\nBoth Shon and Dred comment on the dearth of women of color who are interested in becoming drag kings. In a Jackson Five act that Dred and Shon put together, for example, they had to use men for some of the roles. They have a hard time explaining why more women of color do not get involved; but both are confident that as time goes on and as drag king popularity grows, more women of color will develop stage drag king acts. In their show, Dred and Shon mix up the music and the style that each of them favors. In their fifteen-minute “R’n’B Old School Show” that they performed at HerShe Bar to an audience of screaming women, they included rap songs by Run DMC and did the duet “You’re All I Need” by Method Alan and Mary J. Blige. They also performed a hot and flashy rendition of “No Diggety” by Blackstreet, which actually reproduced the scenes of screaming female fan response that usually accompany live performances by Blackstreet.\n\nDred and Shon’s show is an extremely entertaining combination of male impersonation, perfectly timed lip-synching, and choreographed dance moves. They manage to pull off close replications of the performers they imitate, and in many of their shows parody gives way to homage.

Producer associations would thus accumulate reserves in good years, which would enable them to assist their members in bad years. Such a scheme would not eliminate the need for subsidies, but this need would occur much less frequently.\n\n15. Market Regulations are Needed. Because cotton is an annual crop requiring large investments which have to be amortized over many years, the sector has to be liberalized cautiously. It is important to prevent entry of traders aiming at making a quick profit without concern for the future of the sector, because they have no sizable investments in it. In several countries, the entry of such traders led to poaching, credit arrears, decline in the utilization of purchased input, and ultimately the stagnation of cotton production. A decade ago, it had too often been assumed that once parastatals would have been dismantled and prices liberalized, the private sector would step in automatically to fill up the vacuum. But it did not occur either in Ghana or in Tanzania and, after the previous credit and distribution system had been dismantled, it proved difficult to establish a new one.\n\n16. The CSPR is an Original and Interesting Experiment. The objective of the reforms in Benin was to preserve the advantages of the public monopoly after having replaced it by several private companies which became mere partners. The new decision center became a group of stakeholders with the CSPR as its executive arm. The CSPR was a clearing house for all the financial transactions of the sector. It was created to insure full recovery of input credits and timely payments. The new system is highly regulated and required the creation of new institutions. The system has been working satisfactorily in 2001/02, but its net benefits have still to be assessed.\n\n17. Local Sales. The share of cottonseeders in the earnings SOFTIEX and CMDT has more than doubled in the last six years, which shows that the fiber byproducts remained undervalued for many years. Further gains can be achieved, since the demand for cattle feeding is not yet satisfied. But performances by local textile industries have generally been disappointing. Although they acquired the fiber below world market prices, they seldom succeeded in becoming internationally competitive. In Tanzania and Zimbabwe, the reduction of subsidies after liberalization of the cotton sector led to a sharp retrenchment of the local textile industry.\n\n18. Sequencing of Reforms. As shown by the experience of Ghana and Tanzania, liberalizing the purchase of seed cotton can induce poaching if appropriate measures have not been taken to insure full recovery of input credits; experience has shown that, once poaching has become widespread, eliminating it is difficult. The sector can be liberalized more easily when world prices are high than when they are low. This does not mean that nothing should be done when world prices are low; it suggests that emphasis should then be placed on measures which can reduce production costs with minimal risks of destabilizing the sector.\n\n19. Main conclusions:\n\na. An efficient credit system allowing small farmers to acquire quality inputs in a timely manner is a prerequisite for developing the cotton sector and reducing poverty. For this purpose, a direct link must be preserved between the payment of seed cotton and the recovery of input credits."}

The prestigious architectural firm of McKim, Meade and White was a staunch champion of the Renaissance Revival style. Not only did they receive many important commissions (including re-decoration of The White House), but they also founded the American Academy in Rome, an organization dedicated to the study of Classical ideals.\n\nThe revival of these aesthetics held sacred during the Renaissance, Ancient Rome and Greece, were openly pursued by White and his colleagues. The picture frames he designed were carefully conceived to blend into the environment created by the architecture. The interiors possessed classical ornamentation of elaborate cornices and rich detail. As a result, White’s frames were a logical choice for artists aspiring to similar ideals. Some of the patterns were inspired by the tabernacle style used by Piero della Francesca during the Renaissance (Fig. 1). The primary characteristic of the tabernacle style is an entablature supported by two pilasters flanking the perimeter of the painting. Other patterns he created resemble a “Whistlerian” profile, but instead of simple fluted reeds, White designed a variety of patterns with a Greek wave design, chevrons, twisted rope and ribbon, all combined into one flat profile (Fig. 2).\n\nAlthough White produced many designs (Fig. 3), the most innovative and distinctive pattern was the grille frame that resembles a gilded lattice or lace, suspended one inch over a brightly gilded panel. As a result of the panel’s reflection from below, it produces a dazzling effect with only small amounts of available light. An optical illusion is produced that makes it appear that light is emanating from within the frame. This “halo” is particularly effective when combined with the luminescent quality of Dewing’s paintings (Fig. 4). It may be for these reasons that Dewing preferred this style for many of his paintings. Unfortunately, these frames are extremely fragile and they are often found in a broken and deteriorated condition as a result of normal wear and tear for almost a century. Originally, these frames were well-constructed and the method used in gilding followed traditional techniques that are passed down from master craftsmen to apprentice among the gilding shops of Europe.\n\nThere are several variations in manufacturing the grille pattern of these frames. One method consists of a wire mesh covered with a thick geos (pastiglia) built up and dripped onto the thin metal wire to form an ornamental shape (Fig. 5). As this method must have been laborious, another type of grille appears that is made from “compo\\*t” reinforced with a paper backing (Fig. 6). This latter type is the subject of the following conservation and fabrication discussion.\n\nBrief Summary of the Conservation of Thomas Dewin Frame for “The Lute Player” (1905); Freer Gallery of Art; Smithsonian Institution: Washington, D.C.\n\nThis Stanford White frame had been damaged from impact during shipping and handling. As a result, the grille was broken and pieces were missing in numerous areas which required treatment. Another problem was that the original surface had been covered with a bronze or “radiator paint” as a feeble attempt to refurbish the gold. In order to bring the frame back to its original condition, the bronze paint was removed using chemicals, to reveal traces of the original gilding.

For instance, a total of 79 bacterial isolates dominated by the genus *Bacillus* were obtained from four hot springs in Morocco [10]. In another study, a collection of 161 strains of *morphicella Bacillus* were also isolated from Tunisian hot springs [11]. Additionally, different Indian hot springs were studied and several strains belonging to the genera *Bacillus* and *Geobacillus* were isolated [12, 13].\n\nRecently, we have applied a culture-independent approach to reveal the microbial diversity in Jordanian hot springs represented by Ma'în and Afra hot springs [14]. As a spinoff of this study, important data about the diversity of certain genera became available. In this current study, we aimed primarily to review the abundance of the genus *Bacillus* in Jordanian hot springs (Mainly Ma'în and Afra springs) based on these data generated by the Illumina MiSeq which was not utilized before for this purpose. Secondly, the species composition of the genus *Bacillus* would be determined because most studies did not identify the thermophilic/thermotolerant *Bacillus* isolates to the species level.\n\n**MATERIALS AND METHODS**\n\nThe new findings in this study were generated from unpublished metagenomic data emerged from a recent published work done by our group on samples obtained from Ma'în and Afra hot springs [14].\n\n**Sampling of Hot Springs Water:** Water samples were collected from four Jordanian hot springs; three samples were collected from Ma'în hot springs (HS1), HS2 and HS3) and one sample from Afra hot springs (HS4) as mentioned before [14]. Sample collection was carried out in June, 2015 at imenendist previously by our group and the *in situ* temperature of water ranged between 38 to 59°C whereas the pH values ranged between7.4 to 8.4 [14].\n\n**DNA Isolation:** DNA was isolated as described before [14], briefly, water samples were filtered under vacuum using 0.2 µm-thincellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes containing the trapped cells were cut into pieces and transferred to sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube. The E.Z.N.A® Water DNA kit (Omega Biotech Ltd., India; catalog No. D5525-01) was used for DNA extraction. The resulted DNA was finally stored at -20°C for further analysis.\n\n**Amplicon Sequencing:** Amplicon sequencing using next generation technology (BTEFAP®) was used to analyze the water samples as described previously [14]. Briefly, the 16S universal bacterial primers 515F (GTCCGACACMGGCGCTGAAT) and 806R (GGACTACHTWGCCCTTTGAAAT) were used to evaluate the species richness and abundance of each sample including the genus *Bacillus* on the Illumina MiSeq with methods via the BETFAP® DNA analysis service. The PCR using Hot Star Taq plus Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was done as described previously [14]. Samples were sequenced utilizing the Illumina MiSeq chemistry following manufacturer's protocols. The Q25 sequence data derived from the sequencing process were processed using a proprietary analysis pipeline (www.mrdnalab.com, MR DNA, Shallavoter, TX).\n\n**Data Analysis:** Visualization and analysis of results was done using Krona software. Krona software allows hierarchical data to be explored with zooming, multi-layered pie charts. Microsoft Excel 2010 was also used to generate the abundance charts.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n**Abundance of the Genus *Bacillus*:** The abundance of the genus *Bacillus* within the family *Bacillaceae* was determined relative to different taxonomic levels. The genus *Bacillus* was found predominantly the family *Bacillaceae* in three samples out of four (HS2, 48%; HS3, 77% and HS4, 61%; Table 1). However, in sample HS1, the genus *Bacillus* was found to be the second most abundant genus (22%; Table 1). The abundance of *Bacillus* was also calculated relative to higher taxa. The genus was dominating at the order *Bacillales* and class *Bacilli* only in case of HS2 (64%). However, the abundance was lower in HS1 (18%), HS3 (47%) and HS4 (39%; Table 1). At the level of the phylum *Firmicutes*, the genus constituted 7% in HS1, 41% in HS2, 31% in HS3 and 33% in HS4 (Table 1). Relative to the domain *Bacteria*, the abundance of the genus was found to be very low: 2% (in HS1), 3% (in HS2), 0.5% (in HS3) and 1% (in HS4; Table 1). Because *Bacillus* was not the dominant genus within the family *Bacillaceae* in HS1, further investigation was carried out to clarify the relative abundance of genera other than *Bacillus* within the family."}

Where can we host our Linked Data so that it can be accessed by others interactively?**\n   There is an increasing trend in opening up project data from the project's start. But, it is hard to publish your data as Linked Open Data that is both findable and reusable with the help of stable permalinks (i.e. URIs). Reasons for this are a lack of proper infrastructure that allows for curation as well as publication, and a lack of triplestores where data can be hosted.\n\n   Opening up your data at an early stage possibly prevents other projects from doing duplicate work. Moreover, it enables others to provide feedback on the project, when it is still shapeable. It is thereby essential to have community serving and stable URIs others can rely on. Unfortunately, it is not a given that URIs stay permanent, are dereferenceable, and are meaningfully described.

As such, it is kept in one data silo, ideally, where possible, linked to common thesauri such as ULAN or VIAF (or Dutch equivalents RKDArtists and the Dutch Thesaurus of Authors (NTA)). Logically, such outgoing links can only be made to authoritative records for the entities that are already known somewhere, and that are already well-documented. This implies even beforehand that the entities that do not conform to such criteria are unlinkable, or are hindered in being spotted by similar and/or follow-up projects. The question is then how to disclose an entity when an authoritative record is not available?\n\n   We have to face the fact that we cannot construct authoritative databases of the same level and quality as the mentioned (curated) person thesauri.

This information proves is believed to drive the increase in goblet cell differentiation, which is observed in Crohn’s disease patients [15]. However, it is important to note that this increase in goblet cells is not found in all Crohn’s disease patients, or throughout the whole gastrointestinal tract [16].\n\nMaintenance of intestinal homeostasis is regulated by epithelial barrier integrity [17]. Diffusion of the luminal materials into lamina propria promotes a local inflammatory response causing release of proinflammatory cytokines, release of MMPs, and epithelial degradation and inflammation [18]. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-15 were increased in IL-1α−/− mice, and these results are in agreement with those obtained from patients with Crohn’s disease [19]. IL-1α and IL-1β are also expressed in human intestinal epithelial cells [20]. IL-1α is released when these human intestinal cells are damaged or destroyed, and IL-1α was commonly detected in the epithelium of IBD, released from necrotic intestinal epithelial cells and plays a crucial role in intestinal inflammatory biology in human gastrointestinal fibrosis to produce IL-6 and IL-8 [21]. The high concentrations of IL-1β in the intestine of patients with Crohn’s disease are mainly attributed to local mononuclear cell infiltration [22], which were also observed in this model. Increased production of IL-1β and TNFα in inflamed Crohn’s disease mucosa induces the synthesis of IL-8, which is an effective neutrophil chemotacticant [23]. These findings agree with previous work, which showed increased numbers of TNFα positive cells in the lamina propria and submucosa of patients with Crohn’s disease. Further, TNFα produced by epithelial macrophages has been shown to contribute to decreased epithelial migration [24]. TNFα acts as an important mediator of inflammatory through MAPK and NF-κB activation, increasing cell proliferation and altering epithelial barrier permeability [25]. The production of TNFα is also high in cultured mucosal mononuclear cells from Crohn’s disease patients [26]. However, in contrast, a previous study observed no differences in TNFα mRNA expression between control and IBD mucosal biopsies [27].\n\nIL-1R1 is expressed on many cell types including T cells, fibroblasts, and intestinal epithelial cells. Despite the increased expression of IL-1β in the IL-1R−/− mice, the expression of IL-1R was reduced; this could suggest a negative feedback loop decreasing expression of IL-1R1 in the presence of uncontrolled IL-1 production. This agrees with a previous study, which showed IL-1β and TNFα treatment downregulated the expression of mRNA IL-1R1 in rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) [28]. Similarly, IL-1β treatment was also shown to downregulate IL-1R1 protein in retinal endothelial cells (TR-IBR2B) [29]. This is contrary to previous study, in which an increase in IL-1β induced chronic intestinal inflammation in mice and an increase in IL-17A-secreting innate lymphoid cells which express high levels of IL-1R1 [30]. These differences may be a result of the different levels of inflammation seen in these models. Here, increased expression of IL-15 was seen in IL-1R−/− mice, this is in agreement with Liu et al (2000), who showed increased expression of IL-15 by macrophages in the inflamed ileum of patients with Crohn’s disease and that IL-15 increased local T cell activation and induced proinflammatory cytokine production by T cells and macrophages. The presence of polymorphonuclear cells and mononuclear cells play an important role in the augmentation of inflammation and tissue damage in IBD [31]. Increased infiltration of these CD15 and CD68 positive cells into the lamina propria were observed in IL-1R−/− mice compared with WT mice. These findings are in agreement with previous findings which showed increased numbers of these cells in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients [32]. Infiltration of immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes in the lamina propria is an important aspect of IBD, especially Crohn’s disease, even in the lack of noticeable morphological, clinical, and endoscopic indication of inflammation. This is thought to be due to an increased demand of macrophages within the inflamed intestinal [33]. Functional assessment of this increased inflammatory response such as calprotectin measurement in stool samples would have been a useful assessment, however unfortunately these samples were not available in this study.\n\nMMPs and ADAMTS1 expression were not significantly altered in IL-1R−/− mice. MMPs have been demonstrated to be induced in several pathological conditions of IBD and play a key role in regulating the pathophysiology of IBD [34]. The main action of MMPs is to degrade extracellular matrix proteins. Active MMP2 and MMP9 play an important role in cell migration and cytokine stimulation. Indeed neutrophil infiltration has been shown to be induced by upregulation of MMP9 in murine inflamed intestinal [35]. Furthermore, stromal cells play an important role in intestinal inflammation and the production of IBD. These cells secrete MMP2 and MMP9 [36]; and MMP9 is produced by human colonic epithelium during IBD [37]. In addition, infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils are the main source of MMP9 in human IBD [38]. Overexpression of MMP9 has been shown to cause a reduction in the differentiation of progenitor cells to goblet cells and consequently decreased MUC2 expression, which leads to decreases in the protective mucin barrier in colonic epithelium [35].\n\nThe maintenance of epithelial barrier function and control of paracellular permeability are regulated by tight junction proteins [39]. Epithelial disruption and decrease in tight junctions that lead to increased intestinal permeability are the common features of Crohn’s disease [40].

It therefore forwarded the draft monographs to the Governments concerned for verification and comment and revised them in the light of the observations received. Where no observations were received after several months, the Committee decided reluctantly to issue the monographs as conference room papers with an appropriate note indicating that the text had been forwarded to the Governments concerned. Altogether the Committee had prepared eight-night country-monographs which provided a basis for its study.\n\n44. In its report, the Committee indicated the meanings of \"arrest\", \"detention\", and \"exile\". It was of the view that \"arbitrary\" meant more than \"illegal\", and that an arrest or detention was arbitrarily if it was of no grounds or in accordance with procedures other than those established by law, or (b) under the provisions of a law the purpose of which was incompatible with the right to liberty and security of person (E/CN.4/826, para. 23 to 30, article 1 of the draft principle). The report was divided into six parts.\n\n45. Part I dealt with fundamental or constitutional principles relating to arrest, detention and exile. The fact that provisions concerning personal liberty were embodied in constitutions continued to the protection of that liberty, since in most systems constitutional could be amended only in accordance with special procedures; and the course was often directed to ensure that ordinary legislation conformed with the fundamental law. In part I, the Committee also considered some basic questions relating to the independence of the judiciary, since judges were vested with the greatest responsibility in matters relative to personal liberty.\n\n46. Part II related to arrest and detention of persons accused of a criminal offence. This part was divided into four sections.\n\n(a) Section A dealt with the grounds upon which, and the procedures according to which, a person suspected or accused of a criminal offence might be arrested or detained; duration and review of detention pending investigation and trial; and provisional release.\n\n(b) The rights of an arrested or detained person were examined in section B: the right to be informed of his rights and obligations; and of the criminal offence; the right to communication; the right to obtain the assistance of counsel, to communicate with counsel, and to have him participate in the preliminary examination; the rights relating to interrogations, including protection of the arrested or detained person against treatment which tends to impair his freedom of action, memory and judgement at interrogations; and treatment in places of custody.\n\n(c) Section C was devoted to a study of the remedies available to the arrested or detained person, and to various sanctions for the violation of his rights. Special attention was given to the procedures which were available to the arrested or detained person, or to other persons on his behalf, to terminate wrongful detention and restore freedom; those included both regular appeals provided for in the code of criminal procedure and special remedies such as habeas corpus and amparo. Also dealt with in section C were penal and disciplinary sanctions, and compensation for wrongful arrest or detention.\n\n(d) Section D dealt with arrest and detention under administrative penal law.\n\n47. In part III, the Committee considered various cases of detention on grounds unconnected with criminal law: detention grounds of unsound mind, of aliens pending deportation, detention on grounds of contempt of court, detention for debt, etc.\n\n48. Part IV dealt with arrest and detention in emergency or exceptional situations. The Committee noted that, under the emergency laws of many countries, the right of everyone to personal liberty may be more restricted and judicial remedies may be available to a lesser extent, than under ordinary laws.\n\n49. In part V, the laws and practices relating to exile and to banishment of a person within his own country were examined.\n\n50. Part IV of the report contained draft principles on the right of everyone to be free from arbitrary arrest and detention. The question of exile was not dealt with since this institution was in the process of disappearing. Also, the Committee had refrained from coming out categorically for the complete abolition of exile since, in certain cases at least, exile might constitute a relatively humane substitute for incarceration.\n\n51. The Commission considered the report at its 735th meeting, on 12 April 1962. It was generally agreed that the report as well as the draft principles, dealt with very important questions on which Governments should be requested to submit comments. In view of this consideration and in view of the lack of time, the Commission declined to limit its discussion to a draft resolution (E/CN.4/L.625) of a procedural character submitted by the representatives of Afghanistan, Austria, Denmark, El Salvador and Venezuela, which read as follows:\n\n\"The Commission on Human Rights,\n\n\"Human rights taken note of the revised report of the Committee on the Right of Everyone to be Free from Arbitrary Arrest, Detention and Exile (E/CN.4/826 and Corr.1 and 2), including draft principles concerning freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention,\n\n\"1. Expresses its appreciation to the Committee for the study which it has made;\n\n\"2. Decides to transmit the draft principles to States Members of the United Nations and its specialized agencies and to request them to submit comments thereon by 31 October 1962;\n\n\"3. Decides to consider the draft principles at its next session in the light of the comments of Governments."}

The Interlocal Agreement also provides for one of the Districts (the “Administration District”) to operate and maintain, on behalf of the Issuer for the benefit of all of the Districts, any portions of the Community Infrastructure not conveyed to another governmental entity. The Issuer may also finance, acquire and construct the infrastructure necessary to serve the property within the boundaries of a specific District (the “District Infrastructure”), subject to the reserved rights of each District to finance the acquisition and construction of its own District Infrastructure. District Infrastructure may be operated and maintained by the Administration District or the applicable District in which such District Infrastructure is located to the extent not conveyed to another governmental entity.\n\nThe Community Property will be assessed costs associated with the Public Infrastructure based on its relative benefit as identified in the master assessment methodology report prepared by Fishkind & Associates, Inc. and approved by the Community Property Districts, as supplemented from time to time, including as supplemented by a report dated August 1, 2019 prepared by Special District Services, Inc., the current assessment methodology consultant to the Districts.\n\nSouthern Grove Community Development District No. 5 (“CDD No. 5”) is currently serving as the Issuer under the Interlocal Agreement. It has previously issued its $2,655,000 in original principal of its Bond Anticipation Note, Series 2014 (Community Infrastructure) (the “2014 CI Note”) to finance a portion of the Community Infrastructure, as described in the Second Supplement (the “2014 CI Project”). CDD No. 5 has also issued its $5,800,000 in original principal amount of its Bond Anticipation Note, Series 2014 (District Infrastructure) (the “2014 DI Note”) to finance a portion of its own District Infrastructure (the “2014 DI Project”).\n\nSubsequent to the approval of the Original Engineer’s Report, the Districts approved certain supplements to the Original Engineer’s Report, which, by recent action of the governing boards of the Districts, have been rescinded as of the date hereof.\n\nSubsequent to the Second Supplement, a change occurred in the ownership of a significant portion of the undeveloped land in the Districts (the “Significant Undeveloped Land”). CDD No. 5, as the current “Issuer,” the owners of the Significant Undeveloped Land and the Consulting Engineer have formulated a revised Community Infrastructure program, based on the current expected development plan for the Community Property (the “Current Development Plan”), which"}

Approval of an Ordinance amending Title 6 of the North Aurora Code Regarding Animals\n\nThe Village Board discussed this at the last Village Board meeting on August 19th. The Board was comfortable with the allotment of four animals with no specie regulations in regards to the number of one specific species. There was a lot of discussion at the last meeting in regard to emotional support animals. Most revolved around the hesitancy of allowing farm animals as emotional support animals. The draft ordinance has been updated. Changes include removal of the language in terms of the weight limitation of animals non-native to the American continent. Limiting service of emotional support animals’ exemption to ducks, swine and miniature horses. Specific conditions were made for the living condition for ducks, swine and miniature horses. Added language regarding the “at large” provisions as well as the grandfathered clause. Toth noted that if a grandfathered animal passes, if that number exceeded four animals, the owner could not replace that grandfathered animal. Motion for approval made by Trustee Curtis and seconded by Trustee Lowery. Roll Call Vote: Trustee Gaffino – yes, Trustee Lowery – yes, Trustee Curtis – yes, Trustee Martinez – yes. Trustee Guethle – yes. Motion approved (5-0).\n\n2. Approval of an Ordinance Amending Title 3 of the North Aurora Code by Adding Chapter 3.18 Imposing a Municipal Cannabis Retailers’ Occupation Tax\n\nFinance Director Bill Hannah stated that the new state law provides recreational cannabis be subject to normal state taxes plus a number of other state taxes. A municipality has the option of implementing a local sales tax up to 3% in quarter percent increments. This new taxing option is currently not scheduled to be allowed until September 1, 2020, but there has been mention that there is future consideration for legislation which would allow for this to be in effect on January 1, 2020. Since there is a 90 day tax rate change that can be made, the Village would need to consider this tax ordinance in September in order to file by September 30th. Motion for approval made by Trustee Gaffino and seconded by Trustee Guethle. Trustee Curtis asked if this would also apply to the sale of medical marijuana. Hannah said this ordinance would only apply to recreational cannabis.

If they did not meet my culture test, they were not hired. By the time I was running the company I had been involved hiring most of the non-field personnel.\n\nOne other thing I am proud of doing at Raymond, for numerous reasons, was a safety program. I did not know much about insurance other than it was something a company had to have. One day shortly after I started working at Raymond the insurance agent came to meet with Carl and Jim Pecora and they asked me to come meet the agent. The agent said he had renewed the insurance and needed a check for $xxx.xx. My jaw dropped, but I kept quiet. After the agent left, I asked how the process worked. For the dollars involved I thought we should have gotten competitive bids. From that day on I used a risk management consultant to renew insurance every year. Three brokers were chosen to give quotes. We chose the broker we thought would give us the most for our dollar throughout the policy period. That was not always the lowest quote at renewal time. Result: Better coverage, better service and lower cost.\n\nI did some research and found the workmen's compensation (WC) was the big dollar insurance. I found out the WC premium was $5 per $100 of payroll modified by an experience modification (Xmod) based on accident losses. Wow, this can be a forever growing cost as union wages went up, the company grew, and especially if you did not control accident losses. I told Carl and Jim I was going to start a safety program. They chuckled and said, \"Go ahead but I won't work.\" I started holding safety meetings in Montebello in 1978 and led almost every safety meeting, even though I had to drive or fly to the remote offices to do so, until I retired in 2004. I ran the foreman safety meetings, then the foremen held a safety meeting at their job site. Because Raymond's projects were all over the greater LA basin, I had a young woman that kept track of insurance, safety, etc. set up foremen meeting places in different areas so the foremen did not have to always drive to our office. We had food and soft drinks, we always had a safety topic to talk about, and we acknowledged safety achievements with personal recognition and a small non-monetary gift, usually a personalized coffee cup. The greatest reward for me in this process was getting to know the foremen. Everyone in the company is important, but if you don't have foremen who can organize a crew to execute that set of plans within the \"estimate\" the office turned out, you are in trouble. These guys (not enough gals) were smart, creative, talented, great supervisors and managers. I have the greatest respect for them, and I really enjoyed being among them at these meetings and on the job sites. It was, and is, amazing what they can achieve.\n\nWhen I began the safety program Raymond's Xmod was say 1.15 for an example. That means if the WC rate was $10 per $100 of payroll, Raymond would have to pay $11.50 because of accident losses. In a couple of years, I had Raymond's Xmod down to 0.39, or $3.90 per $100 of payroll. It was impossible to hold the Xmod that low, but the safety program made it possible to keep Raymond's Xmod below 1.00 most of the time after that. It was good for the men because there were fewer injuries. It was good for the company because it made Raymond more competitive, or more profitable, however you played the cost advantage. During my time at Raymond, the safety program saved several million dollars of insurance premiums. I suspect that is still the case."}

On the basis of the optimal balance model and the iterative processing model, these changes should interact to foster improvements in self-regulation.\n\nResearch with adults indicates that mindfulness training does indeed improve performance on a variety of measures of self-regulation (e.g., Baer, 2003; Chambers, Lee, & Allen, 2008; Heeren, Van Broeck, & Philippot, 2009; Mind and Life Education Research Network, 2012; Zeidan, Johnson, Diamond, David, & Gookeshian, 2010; Zylowska et al., 2006) and that it is associated with greater activation in the PFC networks underlying self-regulation (see Hölzel et al., 2011, for a review). For example, in a randomized design, 7 weeks of mindfulness training lessened the tendency for negative stimuli to interfere with a simple cognitive task (with corresponding reductions in skin conductance responses to these stimuli), as compared to an active control group trained in relaxation meditation (Otter, Kilner, & Zelazo, 2007). Following an 8-week MISR course, participants showed increased activation in right dorsomedial and ventrolateral PFC when attending to present experiences (Farb et al., 2007). In addition, there is evidence for greater PFC activation during other tasks in individuals who are higher in mindfulness (Creswell, Way, Eisenberger, & Lieberman, 2007) and in individuals who have more experience with meditation (Hölzel et al., 2007).\n\n**ADAPTING MINDFULNESS PRACTICES FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS**\n\nStandard adult exercises have been adapted for use with children and adolescents to create developmentally appropriate ways to train the core aspects of mindfulness, including non-judgmentally noticing one’s moment-to-moment experiences, monitoring attention and redirecting attention when it has wandered, and nonrestrictively observing one’s thoughts and feelings. A recent surge of research has revealed that children and adolescents readily engage in these activities and enjoy doing so (Biegel, Brown, Shapiro, & Schubert, 2009; Broderick & Metz, 2009; Huppert & Johnson, 2010; Schoenert-Reil & Lavie, 2010; see Burke, 2010, for a review).\n\nAs with adults, mindfulness training for children and adolescents typically occurs in small-group sessions that include a variety of activities, such as body scans, breathing exercises, and sitting meditations. To compensate for children’s limited self-regulation skills, the lessons and individual training activities are shorter for younger participants. Adults may be able to attend their breathing for 45 min, but 5-year-olds who only manage for 3 min (Burke, 2010). Mindfulness practices may also involve more movement-based activities like yoga stretches or rocking of one’s body, because attempting to remain still for long periods may be so difficult for young children that it interferes with mindful reflection (e.g., Kaiser-Greenland, 2010).\n\nInstructions are typically simplified, and teachers may use props or concrete metaphors to help children understand the goals of mindfulness exercises. For example, to help children understand the notion of a body scan, a teacher may tell children that he or she will use a hula-hoop as a scanner, just like the scanner at the grocery store that shines a light on each item it passes. Once children have practiced with the hula-hoop, the teacher may look at a group exercise where children use an imaginary hula-hoop to scan their bodies (e.g., Johnson et al., 2011).\n\nProps may also help children focus on their breathing. For example, a teacher may place a stuffed animal on a child’s abdomen and instruct the child to rock it to sleep with gentle breaths (Kaiser-Greenland, 2010). In addition, to foster children’s mindful awareness of the sensation of touching, children may be asked to manipulate a common object that they are holding behind their back, and notice how the object feels (e.g., “What is the texture of the object?” Is it smooth or rough?”). Such exercises provide an opportunity to emphasize easily overlooked aspects of their experience: If children touch the object and tell the teacher what the object is (e.g., it’s a key”), the teacher may redirect their attention (saying, “I don’t want you to tell me what it is—I just want you to notice how it feels to you”).\n\nAsking children to focus their attention on their sensations may help the foundation for mindful awareness of more complex aspects of their subjective experience, such as emotions or thoughts. For example, children may be told that thoughts pass through the mind like floats pass by in a parade; some of the floats (thoughts) may grab their attention more than others, but just as they would not jump onto a float at a parade, they can simply observe their thoughts as they occur (Saltzman & Goldin, 2008).\n\nThroughout all of these activities, teachers’ own behavior can serve as an important model for children’s harmonious mindfulness skills. In addition, parents, teachers, and caregivers may turn many daily experiences into opportunities to promote mindful awareness by producing children who notice what is happening in the current moment in a purposeful and nonreactive way. For example, during meals, parents might challenge their children to reflect on the food they are eating: “Is it hot or cold? Is it hard or soft?” During a sad moment, parents might ask children, “Where do you feel sad; is it your eyes, is your throat, is your chest?” Before bedtime, parents might ask children to take deep breaths and notice how their body feels calmer after breathing slowly.\n\n**POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF MINDFULNESS TRAINING**\n\nFrom the perspective of the iterative reprocessing model, these age-appropriate mindfulness training activities target both top-down and bottom-up influences on self-regulation. That is, training attention to one’s moment-to-moment experiences exercises top-down reflection, in addition, practice being nonjudgmental produces calmness and well-being, as does focusing on the present moment instead of, say, minimizing over a recollected source of anxiety. Thus, at both the cognitive level (attention) and the emotional level (evaluation), mindfulness training disrupts the automatic elicitation of emotional responses, resulting in greater"}

In an age when few westerners could swim, many slaves mastered the skill. Recreational swimming allowed field slaves to relax and cleanse themselves. When bondpeople competed in races or battled marine creatures, they exhibited their skill and won material rewards, which probably enhanced their prestige and self-esteem and increased the slave communities’ sense of cohesion.\n\nSlaveholders probably had to treat enslaved swimmers and divers differently from most other skilled bondpeople. Owners could replace most slave who possessed land-based proficiencies with other competent slaves without interrupting production much. They could not dismiss divers without casting significant work disruption and even stoppages. Enslaved divers thus resembled the angebildin industrial slave laborers whom Charles B. Dew has described. Through years of apprenticeship, which could begin when they were boys, some industrial bondmen became highly skilled laborers who landed themselves in dispensable to iron making. For example, in 1847 the Tiedger Iron Works purchased thirty-two slaves and groomed them for over a decade, making them the elite of its feted population. The time, attention, and money dedicated to their training suggests that replacements could not be readily obtained. Indeed, Dew argued that their positions were secure unless a catastrophe occurred that forced the liquidation of assets, such as the factory owner’s death. Furthermore, industrial slaves seem to have had lifelong appointments that might be passed from father to son. Divers too probably began learning their skills when they were young boys. There is no evidence of diving positions passing from father to son. But enslaved divers would have needed to become proficient swimmers by an early age and to swim regularly to develop the lung capacity and composure required to work calmly and smoothly in strenuous conditions without panicking and using up their oxygen, a reaction that would lessen their efficiency and could cost them their lives. Thus, if slaveholders wanted to train slaves as divers, they probably identified young, proficient swimmers whondivers could tutor.\n\nConsequently, as slave owners engaged in the continually negotiated relationship with their slaves that Ira Berlin has described, they doubtless had to concede some autonomy to their divers and to temper claims to absolute authority. In salvaging goods from sunken ships far out at sea or clearing debris from inland fisheries, slaveholders did not have the luxury of discharging a diver to exhibit their authority or to punish an infraction, and severe beatings could unfit divers for work. Slave owners wanted diving jobs completed quickly and successfully, and they could not easily replace divers. Furthermore, slaveholders may have realized that they were privileged to own slaves possessing such a rare and lucrative ability. Thus, slaves employed in salvage, fishery, and sometimes even pearl diving had leverage to exact privileges from their owners."}

World War I, World War II, and lesser wars of the past century have driven various countries to develop ever more sophisticated and deadly technologies, including wireless communication devices for remote warfare, tanks, stealth aircraft, nuclear weapons, and unmanned aircraft called drones, which have been used in conflicts in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Competition among nations has led to the emergence of the United States as the most militarily powerful nation in the world.\n\nThe expansion of warfare by societies organized as states has not come without cost. Every nation-state has involved civilians in its military adventures, and almost everyone has been involved in those wars in some way—if not as militarily, then as member of the civilian workforce in military industries. World War II created an unprecedented armament industry in the United States, Britain, Germany, and Japan, among others, and the aerospace industry underwent expansion in the so-called Cold War that followed. Today, one can scarcely overlook the role of the process of globalization to explain how the United States, for now an empire, has influenced the peoples of other countries in the world.\n\nStability and Duration of States\n\nIt should be noted that states have a clear tendency toward instability despite trappings designed to induce awe in the wider population. Few states have lasted a thousand years. The American state is more than 240 years old but increases in extreme wealth and poverty, escalating budget and trade deficits, a war initiated under false pretenses, escalating social problems, and a highly controversial presidential election suggest growing instability. Jared Diamond’s book *Collapse* (2004) compared the decline and fall of Easter Island, Chaco Canyon, and the Maya with contemporary societies such as the United States, and he found that overtaxing the environment caused the collapse of those three societies. The Chalmers Johnson (2004) similarly argued that a state of perpetual war, loss of democratic institutions, systematic deception by the state, and financial overextension contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire and will likely contribute to the demise of the United States “with the speed of FedEx.”\n\nWhy states decline is not difficult to fathom. Extreme disparities in wealth, use of force to keep populations in line, the stripping of people’s resources (such as the enclosures in England that removed peasants from their land), and the harshness of many laws all should create a general animosity toward the elite in a state.\n\nYet, until recently (following the election of Donald Trump), no one in the United States was taking to the streets calling for the president to resign or decrying the government as illegitimate. In something of a paradox, widespread animosity does not necessarily lead to dissolution of a state or to an overthrow of the elite. Thomas Frank addressed this issue in *What’s the Matter with Kansas* (2004). Despite the fact that jobs have been shipped abroad, that once-vibrant cities like Wichita are virtual ghost towns, and that both congress and the state legislature have voted against social programs time and again, Kansas continue to vote the Republicans whose policies are responsible for these conditions into office.\n\nNor is this confined to Kansas or the United States. That slaves tolerated slavery for hundreds of years (despite periodic revolts such as the one under Nat Turner in 1831), that workers tolerated extreme conditions in factories and mines long before unionization, that there was no peasant revolt strong enough to reverse the enclosures in England—all demand an explanation. Frank discusses reinforcing variables, such as propaganda by televangelists and Rush Limbaugh but offers little expla-"}

A declaratory entity has a clearly defined territory, a permanent population, and a government capable of controlling the population, its territory, and its resources, and it is recognized by other states. A constitutive state has the same attributes but is not necessarily recognized by other states. ISIS is more like a constitutive state since it is not recognized by any other states. Napoleoni added the concept of a shell state, which she defined as an “armed organization [that] assembles the socio-economic infrastructure” such as taxation and employment services among others of a state “without the political one. i.e., no territory, no self-determination.”\n\nAdministrative Apparatus and Functions\n\nThe best way to understand ISIS as a formative state is to analyze its administrative apparatus and the functions of its subdivisions. As Awan and Nance point out, ISIS is highly centralized with the caliph—Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, also known as Ibrahim—as representative and, arguably, a descendant of the prophet Muhammad and so constitutes the ultimate authority of the state. However, ISIS’s organization is such that if he or any other authority is killed in war, other trained individuals can readily take his place. There are two deputies in each of two senior positions, and they make the final decisions concerning the affairs of ISIS. Reports of the killing of ISIS senior staff members have tended to overlook this arrangement. Desicions are carried out by lower-level deputies in the administration who are allowed discretion in how those orders are implemented, allowing officials to use local knowledge to best execute the directives. These attributes—ready replacement of staff and local decision-making power—provide flexibility to the centralized administrative structure associated with ISIS.\n\nBaghdadi and his deputies rely on various councils and department committees that form their “cabinet.” The top level of administration also has a powerful Shura (consultative) council that endorses the Sharia (religious legal) council’s choice of caliph and then provides advice to him. The Shura council oversees the affairs of state, manages communication, and issues orders on the chain of command and ensures that they are implemented. The twelve-member Shura council is made up members selected by Baghdadi and is headed by one of the senior deputies.\n\nThe Sharia council is charged with formulating regulations and administrative routines consistent with law as spelled out in the Quran and with selecting the caliphs, who are endorsed by the Shura council. It also oversees all matters related to the administration as a whole and manages the judicial affairs of the body politic. Although the Western press has emphasized the more draconian penalties categorized as \\textit{bada} such as amputations for theft and capital punishment by beheading and crucifixion, ISIS’s legal system also allows judges to impose less-severe \\textit{tazeer} punishments designed to publicly shame a miscreant with the aim of reform and rehabilitation. How frequently these two types of enforcement are used is a statistical question that would require a survey that simply cannot be conducted at this time.\n\nWhat is the relationship of the top administrators and their councils to the regional and local administrative bodies? The story begins with incorporation of those bodies into the state. When a city, town, or administrative unit is first occupied by ISIS forces, the first order of business in addition to maintaining the existing police force is to establish a Sharia police force that aims to work toward the “purity” of the Islamic State. Thus, women are enjoined to wear black robes and to veil and men are likewise ordered to wear modest clothing. The “moral police” are dispatched to ensure acceptable"}

Since then, a growing body of research has explored whether the level of income inequality in a society predicts average health or longevity. A second, separate body of research has explored income disparities in these outcomes. These two traditions should be seen as complementary, because understanding the effects of income inequality on individual health requires us to consider its relationship to both average health and disparities in health.\n\nThree promising directions for research are suggested, all of which focus on understanding the mechanisms that link income inequality to average health and health disparities. First, we need more detailed investigation of who is affected by income inequality and how they are affected, since effects are unlikely to be uniform. Second, we need research that takes account of effects that unfold over time, since time lags can be long as well as short. If rising income inequality results in political capture by the rich, for instance, that will affect policy after lags of uncertain but varying duration, and policy changes will in turn affect individuals’ health and mortality after lags of uncertain duration. Third, research must distinguish between direct and indirect effects of income inequality.\n\nIn this report, we describe direct and indirect effects and note prominent theories that predict such effects. We then summarize empirical evidence on the relationships among income inequality, average life expectancy, and socioeconomic disparities in life expectancy.\n\nDIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF INCOME INEQUALITY\n\nDirect effects of income inequality operate through changes in individuals’ own income. Indirect effects operate through changes in other people’s income, which change a society’s political and economic institutions, as well as its customs and ideals. Such broad social changes can, in turn, alter an individual’s incentives and behavior, even if their own incomes have not changed. Indirect effects can change either the average level of health or the slope of the relationship between individual income and health.\n\nDirect effects. By definition, a rise in income inequality increases purchasing power disparities. If more income improves health, larger income gaps between the rich and poor should result in larger health gaps between rich and poor. In addition, the health of the rich benefits less than the health of the poor from each extra dollar of income. In other words, the line connecting income and health is concave downward. Thus, if all else is equal, transferring money from poorer groups to richer groups will reduce average health.\n\nAt least two theories relate direct effects of rising income inequality to average health and health disparities. First, rising income inequality at both the individual and the community level is likely to increase inequality in health-producing material resources, such as nutrition, housing conditions, and education. Second, because material deprivation imposes a cognitive “bandwidth tax” that interferes with decision-making and long-term planning, rising income inequality may take a larger cognitive toll on those nearer the bottom of the income distribution.\n\nAs Figure 1 shows, direct effects depend on whether income inequality grows at the top or the"}

Their relationship is complexly intertwined.\n\nIt was argued that “valuing a work of art works on the most basic principles: supply and demand”³. This is a very contested claim. It would be too simplistic to state that it is just about supply and demand, yet it would be ignorant not to acknowledge these forces. Robertson explains that it depends on the sector of the market you are investigating. In his approach, there appears to be a spectrum where on one end, antiques gain value through a list of aesthetic standards, and on the other end, contemporary art gains value through the judgements of the art world.⁴ These judgements are indeed very difficult to predict. Preece et al. state that this is a reflection of the subjectivity of both art and value, resulting in the determination of a value becoming reliant on constructs, behaviours, and negotiations between actors.⁵ Indeed, as Jyränni adds, “art cannot exist without a human being stating, in a social context, this is art”.⁶\n\nThrosby takes a middle-ground approach, whilst recognising that supply and demand plays a role. He states that the consumer in this market holds a collective taste which changes frequently with the times, thus taste influences demand. On the supply side, the producer (being the artist) is not seeking to maximise profit. He states that artists are of course influenced by their economic situations, but they frequently act in a way that goes against “conventional economic models”.⁷ Therefore, they can be influenced to a certain degree by price when considering supply choices, but that is not their primary concern when producing.\n\nThere is a wealth of debate about the nature of the value of art, be it financial or cultural, and how these two systems work together. The driving force behind a functioning economic system comes from the value that the economic agents ascribe to the goods and services that are being exchanged.⁸ Art is the primary good being produced and consumed on the art market, therefore one needs to understand how and in what way agents create value for art. Art is a heterogeneous entity, whereby each piece is entirely unique and different to the next. This unique nature of art means that traditional economic theories are unsuitable for art market analysis, as they do not consider the specific nature of the art market; they are built to analyse markets where goods are easily interchangeable.⁹\n\n---\n\n² Throsby, “Economic and Cultural Value in the Work of Creative Artists”, 28.\n³ ArtTactic, The 2018 Valuation & Appraisals Market Report, (2018): 20. https://arttactic.com/product/valuations-appraisals-market-report-2018/; 20.\n⁴ Robertson, Understanding Art Markets, 24.\n⁵ Chloe Preece, Finala Kerrigan and Danha O’Reilly, “Framing the work: the composition of value in the visual arts”, European Journal of Marketing 50, no. 758 (2016): 1378.\n⁶ https://dx.doi.org/royalty-arbitration.com/10.1108/EJIM-12-2014-0756\n⁷ Annukka Jyränni, “Contemporary Art Markets – Structure and Actors: A Study of Art Galleries in Finland, Sweden, France and Great Britain”, International Journal of Art Management 4, no.2 (2002): 50. http://www.jstor.com/stable/1404755\n⁸ Throsby, “Economic and Cultural Value in the Work of Creative Artists”, 26.\n⁹ Throsby, “Economic and Cultural Value in the Work of Creative Artists”, 27.\n¹0 Jyränni, “Contemporary Art Markets – Structure and Actors”, 50; Throsby, “Economic and Cultural Value in the Work of Creative Artists”, 26."}

It was my job, as well as others to keep all of this equipment running. These computers were used for various administrative purposes such as payroll, etc. but were heavily used for scientific purposes such as missile design, etc. One of these larger computers was used by NORAD to track missiles, objects in space, etc. A very powerful large scale scientific digital computer at the time. Eventually I was promoted and put in charge of a similar computer site at Chrysler Missile in Warren, Michigan.\n\nI later moved back to California to work at a new company trying to use small computers that had become obsolete for their original design, for use as a payroll system for small manufacturing shops. The computers were old design and needed lots of AC to stay cool. The customer's would not spend the money for the required AC so the machines would overheat and fail. The CEO asked me to pad the amount of time I spent at a customer's site so he could bill the customer for more time than I spent there. I said no and began my plan to exit the company.\n\nRemember fate being right around the corner? Around that same time, I received a call from a V.P. from Philco asking if I would consider returning to Philco. When I asked why, he related Philco had serious problems at the Aeronutronic site. The person in charge was unable to get the situation under control. He wanted me to come back to fix the problems, but I would need to report to the person who was unable to fix the problems. A rather awkward position. In that day computers required 24-hour coverage, so the technicians were rotated through three 3 shifts: 8 am to 4 pm, 4 pm to midnight, and midnight to 8 am. By this time, I had decided to go to college full time, but I would still need to have a part time job. I saw an opportunity, so I told the V.P. I would get them out of trouble if they met my conditions. I would only work the 4 pm to midnight shift, not rotating shifts. The person in charge did not rotate, but always worked 8 am to 4 pm. We could pretend the other person was in charge, and I could pretend I did not report to him if he left work before 4 pm and I came in at 4 pm. Something like two ships passing in the dark. The response was, \"WE CANNOT DO THAT!\" My response was \"OK, GOOD LUCK. THANKS FOR CONSIDERING ME.\" Two days later, \"OK! How soon can you report?\" I ended up with a full-time job with benefits while I would be going to college.\n\nIn about two weeks I had all of the problems resolved. I knew at that point, from my past experience, I could keep everything pouring along, barring any major equipment failure, by doing two hours of preventative maintenance each shift. That left me 6 hours to study and do my homework assignments. Greatest job ever for going to school!! Just as I was to begin my final year at Long Beach State, Aeronutronic decided to discontinue using the larger computer. They were going to continue using the smaller computer I had installed when I first came to that site years ago. Philco told me I would be terminated, and the in-charge person would remain until the smaller computer was to be discontinued. Most of the problems I had been brought back to resolve were associated with the smaller computer system. DAH!"}

Also, with respect to the synthesis, there is no means of knowing that usually operates. Therefore, it is to be accepted that linguistic impression, whose nature is unknown (samantāśarīrapi), is the cause of the pratibhā that takes the form, “This is to be done by this means in this way.”¹⁴¹\n\nThe last line of the passage claims that this pratibhā is caused by linguistic impressions. Why must we think so? Why can the underlying impression not be just a memory impression left by inferential awareness-events that took place in a previous birth? Väcaspati addresses this objection.\n\nThe following is not to be said: “Whatever [awareness] appears wherever either due to a previous birth or insofar as it is produced by that birth, let there be a seed of an impression for that [awareness] in that case. What is the point of language?” Since an impression that is produced by a non-recollective inferential awareness (anumānākāmuhāva) does not cause an awareness that has the form of to-be-done-ness because that inferential awareness has a fact (bhātārtha) as its intentional object, and, in this case [where the agent performs an action], there is no awareness of a mere synthesis which lacks the form of to-be-done-ness.¹⁵\n\nThe impression that gives rise to the practical insight about to-be-done-ness must originate from language, since the other means of knowing, such as inference, etc., only gives us access to facts,\n\n¹⁴ NK on VV³ §11.3, 487.10-17: *gṛam arthāḥ | samītāpatpataneśo hi tītthāndarānamānuttā dṛṣa nunnākavacā pravarante | nāntāvi cāryamati | dṛṣyamādharaṇāgāra āṣa tāpam apāmetam samarthāḥ śāśiratyātiḥ | yad yat tāpam śāśim tat savam tāpāpadamānamartham yadā gantāyāpam | vṣyam oc tathāḥ | tad ita tathāpānamāya ninnigāmāha it | nāni caite padārthā vichamāpatāpatāme samītā paṇḍikāthā āṣa śāśam samāpatāpānamānarthāyam nī dāyatiḥ | nāni caiteya parapārapācaśam antaram kārtavati | yat śāśiyam caityāmi satatamāntapārapācaśam | ya caiteya samuddācāravati | nāni pāmanam ita | vasanā amudāratāpi śādhābhāmiśamadā titham amena kārtayam iti pratibhāthev āśchayā | For a variant, see VVM¹: 178.6-12.\n\n¹⁵ NK on VV³ §11.3, 487.17-18 and 488.1: *na caivyam vācyam | prāgābhāvayam tāpamāpam vā vāya yat pratibhāti tāta tathākāraḥ āṣam iti | kāna śādhāmi ānamāndhākānamāpamānam bhāvamiyā bhāttābhāgacantara kārtayākāndāprapṛthākāravati kārtayākāndāvarthāstya cāthapāśāśamāstvapāratīti | For a variant, see VVM¹: 178.12-15."}

But then someone comes along and falls in love with this bad person and thinks, “Maybe I can help this person if I am with him or her.” In the beginning, this second person is not as difficult, intolerable or crazy as the person he or she has fallen in love with. But eventually the second person will become unhappy and unstable as a result of being with the difficult person. The first person could be an alcoholic and not trying or committing him or herself to sobriety. Then a woman or a man comes along who thinks she or he can help this person stop drinking if they are together. But too often this does not work.\n\nIn Buddhism, as I’ve explained before, there are Ten Worlds. Each individual has these Ten Worlds. But this system also exists within interrelationships between a husband and wife, parent and child, brother and sister, lovers, etc. That is, the Ten Worlds also exist within the relationships with other human beings. Society also has the Ten Worlds. Therefore, if each individual that you deal with has the Ten Worlds, then the point is to accept not just the aspects of the person’s character which you like, but to accept all of the Ten Worlds within each individual.\n\nB2: If a person who is a Buddhist chants, realizes and accepts that mistakes were made, and has apologized for this over a lifetime, but the situation keeps repeating, and the behavior continues, the person may think that chanting doesn’t work because the understanding is that if you just chant it will go away or the situation that triggers that behavior or trait will no longer occur. What do you think about that?\n\nRH: If a person says again and again, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, by making that kind of apology the person is committing another bad action.\n\nSongs is the starting point – to apologize and confess. The next step is introspection and self-reflection. If you don’t reflect on yourself and your own behavior then the bad behavior continues, and it will seem as though chanting does not work because your apologies are just empty words. But as Buddhists, you should have a clear mind about what you are doing. Be more critical and reflective of yourself, questioning your own behavior before you criticize the behavior of others. You should, in fact, be a little easier on others, realizing that they too have the Ten Worlds. This is what liberation Daishionn[^1] taught. The Soka Gakkai,[^2] on the other hand, condones the behavior of its members while showing ill-will towards people who are not Soka Gakkai members, or people who oppose SGI. Yet, they claim they follow the teachings of Nichiren Daishionn, which is entirely false. The demeanor of the Soka Gakkai is the opposite of the teachings of Nichiren Daishionn.\n\n---\n\n[^1]: Ten Worlds - ten conditions of life that are physically and spiritually manifested in a single life. They are: Hell, Hunger, Animality, Anger, Humanity, Heaven (Rapture), Learning, Realization, Bodhisattva, Buddha.\n[^2]: Nichiren Daishionn - (1222-1282) the true Buddha who realized the Law of Manumyoёнрежкёй imbedded in the Lotus Sutra and established the Law as the means by which all livings beings can become enlightened.\n[^3]: Soka Gakkai - SGI – Soka Gakkai International – a lay organization that wrongly incorporates some of the doctrine of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism into its own philosophy and practice."}

Although our products and procedures are designed to minimize exposure to these materials, the possibility of accidents, leaks, spills, and acts of God always exists. Human beings, animals or property could be injured, sickened or damaged by exposure to regulated waste. This in turn could result in lawsuits in which we are found liable for such injuries, and substantial damages could be awarded against us. While we carry liability insurance intended to cover these contingencies, particular instances may occur that are not insured against or that are inadequately insured against. An uninsured or underinsured loss could be substantial and could impair our profitability and reduce our liquidity.\n\nAn inability to win additional government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operations and adversely affect our future revenue.\n\nA material amount of our revenues were generated through a contract with a major U.S. government agency for the period from March 2009 through the contract’s termination in January 2012 totaling $33 million. Subsequent to the contract’s termination, our Company-wide revenues have experienced a decrease compared to prior periods. Although the Company is attempting to secure large additional U.S. Government contracts, including programs with the Veterans Administration, there can be no assurances that such efforts will be successful. All contracts with, or subcontracts involving, the federal government are terminable, or subject to renegotiation, by the applicable governmental agency on 30 days’ notice, at the option of the governmental agency. If a material contract is terminated or renegotiated in a manner that is materially adverse to us, our revenues and future operations could be materially adversely affected.\n\nAs a government contractor, we are subject to extensive government regulation, and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to penalties that may restrict our ability to conduct our business.\n\nGovernmental contracts or subcontracts involving governmental facilities are often subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of other requirements relating to the formation, administration, performance and accounting of these contracts. Many of these contracts include express or implied certifications of compliance with applicable regulations and contractual provisions. If we fail to comply with any regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing governmental contracts or subcontracts involving governmental facilities could be terminated or we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting. If one or more of our governmental contracts or subcontracts are terminated for any reason, or if we are suspended or debarred from government work, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits. Furthermore, as a result of our governmental contracts or subcontracts involving governmental facilities, claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought by the government for violations of these regulations, requirements or statutes.\n\nThe possibility of postal work interruptions and restrictions on shipping through the mail would adversely affect the disposal or treatment element of the Company’s business and have an adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe currently transport (from the patient or user to the Company’s facility) the majority of our solution offerings using USPS; therefore, any long-term interruption in USPS delivery services would disrupt the return transportation and treatment element of our business. Postal delivery interruptions are rare. Additionally, since USPS employees are federal employees, such employees may be prohibited from engaging in or continuing a postal work stoppage, although there can be no assurance that such work stoppage can be avoided. As noted above, we entered into an arrangement with UPS whereby UPS transports our TakeAway Recovery System™ line of solution offerings. The ability to ship items, whether through the USPS or UPS, is regulated by the government and related agencies. Any change in regulation restricting the shipping of medical waste, used healthcare materials or unused or expired dispensed pharmaceuticals through these channels would be detrimental to our ability to conduct operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any disruption in the transportation of products would have an adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company’s stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, low trading volume and price volatility.\n\nOur common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “SMED” since May 6, 2009.

The story cannot be that we were exposed to verbal exhortations in previous lives and thus became aware of to-be-done-ness. For that story does not explain why we only selectively remember to-be-done-ness but not the linguistic expressions that refer to it or the relevant semantic relations. And, if we could remember not only to-be-done-ness, but also these expressions and their semantic relations with to-be-done-ness, then it would be hard to explain why we ever need to learn what these expressions mean. Thus, the epistemological mystery around to-be-done-ness remains unsolved.\\footnote{This is a point that I have made in my book, \\textit{The Epistemology of the Will}, 2014, p. 31.}\n\nGiven this problem, Mañdana could insist that the object of \\textit{praithbā}, i.e, to-be-done-ness, is nothing other than the property of being a means to a desired end. As Mañdana himself notes, his own theory—on which an awareness of this latter property gives rise to actions—does no worse than his opponent’s in explaining how children and other languagesanimals perform various skilled activities without any instruction or antecedent observation. He says:\n\nJust as [on your view] temporally remote language is the cause of \\textit{praithbā} in children, birds, etc. due to the continuity of impressions, why shall it not be accepted that the same kind of awareness with respect to a means is the cause of undertaking or refraining from action due to the continuity of impressions? And differences with respect to species, etc. awaken the impressions left by the awareness of a means just as they awaken the linguistic impressions [on your view].\\footnote{This is a point that I have made in my book, \\textit{The Epistemology of the Will}, 2014, p. 31, and p. 34.}\n\nThe point is that we do not need linguistic impressions to explain how languagesanimals and children perform various actions without any instruction or antecedent observation. We can simply assume that such actions are produced by an awareness of those actions as means to desired ends. How does that arise? Just as the opponent appeals to linguistic impressions to explain the awareness of to-be-done-ness, so also can we appeal to impressions or memory traces left in our past lives by the awareness of the relevant actions as means to desired ends. So, there is no need for us to think that the object of \\textit{praithbā} is anything other than the property of being a means to a desired end.\n\nLet us take stock. Mañdana has shown two things so far. On the one hand, he has noted, using his opponent as a mouthpiece, that we sometimes act just on the basis of the judgement that something is to be done, without considering explicitly whether that action is a means to any end we desire. Cases of skilled unreflective activities performed by children and animals, e.g., suckling, birdsong, etc., support this intuition. On the other hand, we have no good epistemological story about how we become aware of to-be-done-ness at least if the property is irreducibly normative.

Other mesh-based methods also have been used to simulate the necking process, for example, the mixed finite element method [50] and the updated enhanced assumed strain finite element formalism [2]. Of course, these finite element-based methods suffer from mesh distortion issues under large deformations, and are ineffective at dealing with material flow and separation [36, 11].\n\nRecently, meshfree approximations have been used to study the generalized thermoelasticity theories. Various methods have been used, for example, the Meshless local Petrov–Galerkin method [29] as well as methods using radial basis functions [57]. Meshfree methods have also been developed for finite-strain thermoplasticity. Simultaneous have included ductile fracture [49] and friction drilling [43, 54]. Based on variational thermomechanical constitutive updates and the optimal transportation principle (OTM) method [34], the hot OTM method (HOTM) [53] has been developed for modeling external heating and cooling behavior. The HOTM method has mostly been applied to laser cladding technology [23]. Yet, virtually none of these meshfree approaches to thermomechanical equations discussed consider any advanced domain integration techniques other than [43, 54], regardless of the use of classical or generalized equations. For a review of existing techniques and an in-depth discussion on meshfree quadrature including [43, 54], see Part I of this paper.\n\nIn this work, the methods developed in the prepared are developed for generalized thermoelasticity, and generalized thermoplasticity. Namely, the variationally consistent naturally stabilized nodal integration (VC-NSNI) technique is extended to both of these problems. For generalized thermoelasticity, the extension of these two methods is straightforward. Strains and temperature gradients are expanded with implicit gradient approximations for stabilization as before, and the correction remains the same. In finite-strain thermoplasticity, the Cauchy stress and associated variation on strain are instead expanded to stabilize the results. Finally, since the propagation speed of temperature is not well-characterized for most engineering materials, and in most settings (typically this is reported near absolute zero for special materials such as superfluids), equating the second sound speed to the first is investigated. This yields a critical time step in explicit analysis that is the same as in pure solid mechanics problems, but meanwhile very small relaxation times such that the solution is close to the classical theory, which is widely accepted as a good model for thermomechanical problems.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The general governing equations of the coupled thermomechanical theory are discussed in Section 2. In Section 3 classical and generalized thermoelasticity are introduced as special cases, with the RKPM discretization of the weak form given. Section 4 develops thermoplasticity as another more general case, with the Lagrangian RKPM discretization given along with associated explicit algorithms. In Section 5 the time-step criteria is discussed. Benchmarks are then solved for generalized thermoelasticity and classical and generalized thermoplasticity in Section 6, where equating the first and second sound speed"}

The method of converting our present system into the new system is best understood by taking one bank and analyzing what needs to be done to convert it into a deposit bank with 100% reserves behind checking accounts. For this purpose, let us take the Wells Fargo Bank and Union Trust Co., of San Francisco, California. Their Statement of Condition on June 30, 1954 was as follows:\n\nStatement of Condition not reproduced from the original. Totals only are provided here: Total Assets: $515,724,038.74; Total Liabilities: $481,413,566.65; Undivided Profits: $24,853,408.24\n\nMember Federal Reserve System & Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\n*$48,311,886.94 in securities and $500,000.00 of other assets are pledged to secure Public & Trust Deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law.\n\nOur objective will be to divide this bank into two separate and distinct sections – a Deposit Section and a Savings and Loan Section. The function of the Deposit Section will be that of a warehouse, pure and simple. It will operate as the Bank of Amsterdam operated before it became corrupt. Deposits will be accepted for safekeeping. The bank would not be allowed to use these deposits, but would merely facilitate the transfer of claims to these deposits by means of checking accounts. All checks drawn against such deposits would therefore be backed 100% by actual money.\n\nThe function of the Savings and Loan Section will be to obtain the savings of the community for the purpose of making loans to the community. The ideal toward which we should strive is a Savings and Loan Section that obtains rentable funds by selling the bank's bonds. In other words, the ideal Savings and Loan Section of a bank should have a bonded indebtedness to the public rather than deposits that are withdrawals on 30 day notice. And of course, if the bank's loans should mature or no debtor is outstanding bonds. When operating this way, the bank is free to lend all the savings of the community that have been placed with it – rather than having to retain a 5% or 10% cash reserve to honor requests for withdrawals. And the person holding a bank bond always has a liquid asset that can be exchanged for money in the event of an emergency.\n\nIt is not possible, of course, to attain this ideal overnight. But as a start, the Savings and Loan Section of the bank should set up match the same as a Savings and Loan Association. It should have a minimum cash reserve of 5% to honor occasional requests for withdrawals. Then, as to outstanding loans are paid back, it should approach the savings depositors – one by one – and let them that their savings can no longer be held as deposits that can be withdrawn within 30 days. Such deposits would have to decide how long a period he wished to make his money available to the bank and how a bank bond for that period of time. Eventually all savings deposits held by banks at the time of conversion to deposit banks would be converted into bonded indebtedness to the public.\n\nNow let's get down to the practical job of dividing this bank into two separate sections as outlined above. The bank has total demand deposits of $332,395,486.71. These are the deposits against which checks are being drawn and which should therefore be in the newly formed Deposit Section with a 100% reserve behind them. The bank already has cash reserves of $129,940,071.76. (Although these cash reserves include deposits with other banks, the entire amount can be treated as actual cash if all banks are converted to 100% reserves.) To bring the cash reserves of the Deposit Section up to 100% of its deposits requires an additional $202,455.41 (5%). However, the newly formed Savings and Loan Section will also need $7,450,904.00 to give it a 5% reserve behind its deposits (which total $149,018,079.94). So the bank will need a total of $209,906,318.95 in order to split itself into a Deposit Section with 100% reserves and a Savings and Loan Section with a 5% reserve.\n\nThe government will print the required amount of money and lend it to the bank. But since the government already owes the bank $200,563,124.32 (U.S. Government Securities held by the bank), the government will advance the entire $209,906,318.95 to the bank, cancel the government securities held by the bank, and accept the bank's bonds in the amount of $9,343,194.63 to cover the difference.\n\nThe bank's new statement [not produced here from the original] would then appear as follows:\n\nOne point needs to be made crystal clear before going any farther. The preceding plan for converting a"}

The accuracy of your standard of value depends upon how well you maintain a constant relationship between the supply of money and the number of people using that money. Your government maintains the accuracy of your standards of weight and length -- doesn't it? (Man nods) Then isn't it logical that your government should maintain the accuracy of your standard of value also? (Desert) that make sense?\n\nMan: Yes, God, I understand now.\n\nGod: It grieves me to see what is happening down there. You have made such magnificent progress in so many other fields. You could have had a veritable heaven on earth had you made equal progress in economics. But because you failed so miserably in the science of economics, you have never -- as a whole -- enjoyed the fruits of your labor. An honest money -- together with a free market and a sensible system of taxation -- would allow each of you to enjoy the fruits of your labor. But a dishonest money robs most of you, and unjustly rewards a few of you who know how to benefit from dishonest money. Thus you reap against this injustice by abandoning your natural laws instead of providing yourselves with an honest money. (Man remains silent -- so God continues.) I have given you the enlightenment to solve your problems. But I can't -- at least I won't -- force you to use that intelligence. I must a dictator. You people are free agents -- at least those of you who have had the wisdom to maintain your freedom. But unless such a title more intelligently than you have in the past, you who are still free are going to lose your freedom also. Your destiny is in your hands.\n\nMan: But God, even though some of us solved our monetary problem, I'm afraid there's not much we could do about it. It would be too difficult to arouse the people to action.\n\nGod: (with an unbelieving look in his eyes) Too difficult to arouse the public? I can't believe it! Surely they're indignant at having over half the value of their savings taken away from them! Surely they haven't lost their sense of justice! When they lose that, they will lose everything.\n\nMan: No, God. They haven't lost their sense of justice. But they are confused as to what's causing all the injustice. They know they're being robbed. But half of them think: inflation is caused by businessmen raising prices unnecessarily. And the other half think: inflation is caused by labor forcing wages higher than they ought to be.\n\nGod: That's just what's going to destroy you. You are fighting between yourselves instead of fighting your common enemy. Can't! you see that inflation is a direct result of having the supply of money increase faster than the number of people using that money? My law of supply and demand makes that inevitable.\n\nMan: That makes sense to me. And it ought to make sense to everyone else. But even supposing everybody understood this, there's still no hope of making such a basic change in our banking system.\n\nGod: No hope? Have you deteriorated to that extent? (Pause) But then, it's understandable. Naturally, if you've lost faith in me, you would have lost all hope also. Tell me -- how do you expect to survive the emergencies that confront you without faith and hope?\n\nMan: But God, we do have faith in You. Our leaders proclaim that faith daily.\n\nGod: Faith in me must include faith in my laws, and faith in the minds I gave you to understand those laws and use them intelligently. You don't have that faith. The sort of faith you have is not adequate to see you through the difficulties that lie ahead. It is your kind of faith that is destroying you -- slowly but surely. Nothing but a rebirth of a true faith in me and my laws will save you.\n\nMan: But God, let's be practical about this thing...\n\nGod: Practical? I always thought I was very practical. One of the most practical things I ever did was to decide to govern the universe by natural laws rather than by direct intervention. It is Man that isn't being practical. You persist in defying my laws and then have the temerity to ask me to help you out of the chaos that results."}

Based on primary tumor pathology, 86% of patients had squamous cell carcinoma, and the remainder had either adenocarcinoma or adenomyosis.\n\nUsing the training set of 57 samples, genes that were differentially expressed between LN+ patients and LN- were identified. 22 genes showed 1:5 or greater fold differences in expression between the groups with FDR ≤ 0.01 (Table 2). A heatmap of the differentially expressed genes is shown in Figure 1.\n\nOut of the 22 differentially expressed genes, 5 were identified as potential candidates for the predictive model using forward selection: BIRC2, BIRC3, CD300L6, FAM196A, and PHYHIPL. 2 of these genes, FAM196A and PHYHIPL, have very limited gene annotation or relevant clinical background and were therefore excluded from model development. The final five genes, BIRC2, BIRC3, and CD300L6, were included in the training set Random Forest model.

Our pilot study shows that lymph node involvement in cervical cancer can be predicted with RNA-seq data, and our two-gene lymph node predictive signature showed 88% predictive accuracy when evaluated in a separate cohort.\n\nCervical cancer lymph node involvement can be determined by surgically staging or imaging, such as FDG-PETCT or MRI. Several studies suggest that lymph node status on FDG-PET is a more significant predictor of disease outcome than clinical FDG stage [6-8]. The presence of lymph node also influences treatment decisions, such as the need for adjuvant chemoradiation after surgery or the extent of the radiation field and dose for definitive chemoradiation treatment. Currently, no simple lab test that accurately predicts cervical cancer lymph node involvement exists. Additionally, the incidence of cervical cancer is increasing in developing countries with limited health care resources for surgery, imaging, and treatment. A simple pathologic tool that could help stratify patients based on predicted lymph node status could be particularly beneficial for determining the best utilization of treatment resources. If treatment or radiation resources are particularly limited, knowing which patients have no lymph nodes could help identify the patients to treat with a definitive or curative approach versus those to treat more palliatively. Alternatively, if imaging resources are limited but surgical and radiation resources are available, it might be that patients with a biomarker predicting for lymph nodes undergo surgical lymph node resection and/or extended field radiation or additional chemotherapy.\n\nA limited number of microarray gene expression studies have been performed involving cervical cancer, and a few groups have attempted to identify a gene expression signature that can predict lymph node involvement in cervical cancer [9-12]. Many of these studies were relatively small and lacked a validation cohort. Grigsby et al., for example, included 8 cervical cancer patients, 3 with supraclavicular metastases, and identified 75 out of 12,000 genes with at least 3-fold differential expression to create a 12 gene signature to distinguish the groups [9]. Hiewega et al. evaluated tumor samples from 35 patients (16 with lymph node metastases) and found that 5 genes with differential expression had a prediction accuracy of 64.5% [10]. Using 34 primary cervical cancer samples (16 with lymph node metastases), Kim et al. created a lymph node prediction model using 156 genes with a prediction accuracy of 77% [11]. While Huang and colleagues did include a validation cohort, they evaluated early stage cervical cancer patients undergoing hysterectomy with fairly low rates of lymph node metastases [12]. In contrast, our study includes a range of stages, a greater proportion of advanced stage, a higher proportion with lymph node metastases, and also used deep sequencing with RNA-seq that assayed over 16,000 genes, as opposed to microarrays with fewer than 1,500 genes. Unfortunately, these different microarray studies for cervical cancer had minimal overlap in significant genes, suggesting that a new, more"}

The best way to deal with the problem is to combine forward sales with two-step payments by observing three principles: (i) setting a floor price on the basis of realistic market expectations, notably by relying on prices already locked in through forward sales; (ii) incorporating a safety margin which should be wider if the floor price is announced before sowing than before marketing; and (iii) calculating the level of the second payment in a transparent manner according to changes in the CFAF value of Index A and sharing losses or gains proportionally between producers and cotton companies. The calculation could be done easily from daily quotations of the worldwide exchange rate and Index A.\n\nThe third principle departs from the past practices which linked the bonus to the company’s profit. This practice had three drawbacks: (i) calculated profits can be and have been tampered with; (ii) profits are known only after closing the books, which explains why, in Burkina Faso and Benin, the bonus distributed in year t+1 is based on profits made in year t; and (iii) private companies are reluctant to show their books.\n\nThe proposed system could be implemented quickly and would be easier to administer than the previous one. Producers could easily check whether they received their due and cotton companies would be induced to reduce their costs since they would not have to share the fruits of their savings with others.\n\nThe two-step payment provides a protection against future price falling only up to a point. Beyond it, a subsidy is needed if there is no stabilization fund. Requests for subsidies normally come when world prices reach a bottom, and a producer price has to be announced urgently to avoid delaying the opening of the marketing season. The subsidy calculated on the basis of prevailing prices would be too high if prices were to recover. The way for dealing with the price risk in setting the subsidy is similar to the one outlined in setting the floor price. It consists of linking the value of the subsidy to a specified value of Index A and, at the end of the season, adjusting the subsidy according to the difference between the specified value and the actual value.\n\nThe need for subsidies cannot be eliminated. But subsidies should be used only in last resort, which means that alternatives should be found to compensate growers when world prices fall sharply. On the one hand, stabilization funds managed by governments did not function properly because the surplus accumulated in high price years had often disappeared by the time money was needed. On the other hand, funds owned jointly by producers and private cotton companies could be unmanageable. A fund managed by producers may be the only solution left and such a fund has been working reasonably well in Burkina. Producer prices (net of subsidies) would increase at a rate no lower than world prices; but producer associations would become responsible for supporting the revenues of their members when world prices fall. Producers would not be left out in good years, but they would have to protect themselves against bad years.\n\nAn assessment of the impact of the reforms of the cotton sector on poverty has to be crafted with great caution for three reasons. First, reforms in the three CFA countries remain at an intermediate stage and the process followed by any of the three Anglophone countries in liberalizing their cotton sector does not provide a model that CFA countries should copy. Second, the choice of institutional structures has to be fitted to the socio-political context of the country concerned. The model best fitted to Burkina Faso may not fit Benin and vice-versa. Third, the natures of the reforms and their sequence have to be fitted to the initial conditions and the results may be affected by the quality of management as much as by the nature of the reforms.

This conflict can be anticipated and dealt through cultural activities, events and the arts, that can creatively generate new platforms for dialogue. Hull is an important example for this practice. Intercultural initiatives were envisioned since the start, given the relevant presence of migrant workers and their weak recognition within official cultural policy making. In addition, the use of arts and playfulness even for mobilizing heritage building and activating historic places for building a new and more attractive narrative of the city and community proved to be successful. In Wrocław, the collective processing of a difficult cultural identity and social history was stimulated through recognizing specific heritage buildings and places pertaining to multiple communities of the past and of the present. This was a way not only done to valorise heritage for tourists, but also to input social learning and cultural innovation. All the cases showed that promoting social dialogue about and through heritage is much cheaper and less time consuming than managing conflicts that may derive from a different or more intense use of heritage and historic places. While a majority of events occurred in the UNESCO recognized city centre of Matera in 2019, the ECoC also served as an opportunity to recognize and promote other aspects of the city’s less recognized heritage. Several pathways were developed to highlight the modernist neighbourhoods of the city and the unused quarry. Caval del Sole, was converted into an event space with performances taking place throughout the year and utilizing past industrial and landscape heritage spaces in new ways.\n\nCommunication regarding mega-events typically requires one single strong narrative or image for the city and program. This may clash with the multiple interests and perspectives of actors and stakeholders on the transformation of the city in general and it may limit the rich interpretations of heritage and places in particular. In the case of Hull, despite the difficulties and painful memories attached to it, rediscovering the maritime heritage of the city became a great opportunity for planning long-term interventions, as well as for mobilizing different strata and groups of the local and regional population. In this sense, expanding the cultural ownership and the possible narratives for the mega-events and the involved heritage can become strategic also for inclusivity. Clearly, the case of Pafos had to face the heritage of the Turkish Cypriot population, to make sense of the places that historically hosted that community and that became deserted after the 1974 conflict which divided the island’s territory. This was part of the core narrative (despite the overarching motto of the event: “Linking Continents-Bridging Cultures”) but resurfaced in multiple concrete projects as the revitalization of the Mouttallos Turkish-Cypriots neighbourhood that was partially abandoned.\n\n4. From the specificities of case studies to heritage-conscious mega-event policies\n\nThe propositions presented in this article are based on the in-depth study of the five cases and real-time observation of the Matera-Basilicata 2019 ECoC.

In the last twenty years, the share of SSA in world cotton exports increased from 6.9 percent to 17.3 percent. The increase was modest (from 2.0 to 2.1 percent) in Ghana, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, but it was very large (from 2.4 to 9.4 percent) in Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Mali.\n\nFollowing the crises encountered by several public monopolies, reforms were undertaken to improve the competitive position of the cotton sectors. However, as shown in this report, not all reforms were successful. In the Francophone countries, there was no competition on price paid to growers, but the ginning and input sectors have been privatized to various degrees in the last ten years. Reforms are much more advanced in Benin than in Burkina Faso, but results were no better in Benin; as a matter of fact, following the devaluation of the CFA Franc in January 1994, production increased faster in Burkina Faso than in Benin. In the three Anglophone countries, the cotton sector has been liberalized since 1985 in Ghana, 1994 in Tanzania, and 1995 in Zimbabwe. The liberalization was initially a success, but it did not last. In Ghana and Tanzania, production and yields are now lower than they were ten years ago.\n\nIn Burkina Faso, SOFITEX still has a monopoly for the purchase of seed cotton, but producers acquired 30 percent of the company’s shares in 1999 and obtained a majority in the committee responsible for the selection of input bids. Producers participated in the management of the sector and relations between various stakeholders are good; however, producers’ associations remain fragile.\n\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, the CIDT was split into three companies of comparable size in 1998 and, after a two-year transition period, the two new private companies and the remaining part of the CIDT have been operating independently. One of the two new companies was managed better than the old CIDT, but the other was not. Conflicts among stakeholders were frequent; they were fuelled by the north-south political conflict which became open conflicts toward the end of 2002 and led to a confused situation in 2003.\n\nIn Benin, privatization started with the provision of inputs in 1992 and included ginning in 1995. The sequence of measures was not always well designed and a number of problems soon emerged. Most of those have now been solved, notably by establishing a clearing house for all financial transactions of the sector (CSPR); but the sector remains heavily regulated. Producer prices are fixed for the entire country and announced at the beginning of the marketing season, as in the past. With eight cotton companies, surplus ginning capacities, and no competition to clear the market, a new distribution system had to be designed. As a result, a professional association1 allocates quotas to each company on the basis of its installed capacity, and each company is told where to buy its cotton.\n\nIn Ghana, the cotton sector was liberalized in 1985 and this had a stimulating effect. However, production reached a peak in 1989/90 and declined steadily afterward. Free entry led to widespread poaching and the virtual collapse of input credits.2 In March 2002, Ghana had 12 cotton companies with three more applying for registration while the production of seed cotton had fallen to 15,000.\n\n1 L’Association Interprofessionnelle du Cotton (ACI) includes all major stakeholders of the cotton sector: input suppliers, producers’ associations, ginneries, manufacturers and transporters.\n2 Poaching is a way of selling seed cotton without clearing the input credit obtained for producing the seed cotton."}

The copper cable has a fixed cost smaller than that of the optical fiber, but its variable cost is greater than the variable cost of the optical fiber. We also work with primary connectivity constraints that require that primary links be connected to the origin node by a path consisting of primary links only. The reason for using such constraints is that a message which flows from one technology link to another technology link has to undergo some kind of data transformation which implies that a switching device has to be installed at every node where a change of technology takes place. In our problem, the primary connectivity constraints ensure that the number of such devices will be small and the cost of installing these devices is not considered. Another reason for requiring the primary connectivity constraints is that they imply that more paths can benefit from the higher quality of the primary links.\n\nThere are many possible variations of the LAND-2T problem that result in new problems. Balakrishnan et al. [BMM94a] have worked with a problem similar to the LAND-2T where a minimum cost spanning tree that contains an embedded primary subtree connecting all the primary nodes (and optionally including secondary nodes) has to be found. As in the LAND-2T, one can install one of two available cable technologies for each site. Note that they divide the set of nodes into primary and secondary nodes. The primary nodes have to be connected to the origin node by primary arcs. The secondary nodes can be linked to the origin node by primary or secondary arcs. They have proposed a dual-ascent algorithm to find an approximate solution.\n\nGouveia and Janssen [GJ98] have worked with a similar problem that is an extension of the minimal spanning tree problem, but with two cable technologies too. The model that they explore has generalized hop constraints and primary connectivity constraints. Hop constraints limit the number of links (hops) between the root node and any terminal and measure in a certain way the reliability of the tree network. The primary connectivity constraints are the same that we described above. The problem is shown to be NP-hard and procedures to obtain lower and upper bounds are presented. They formulate the problem as a directed multicommodity flow model. To derive lower bounds they use Lagrangean relaxation with subgradient optimization. A Lagrangean heuristic is developed to construct feasible solutions. Moreover, they discuss several different ways of modeling the primary connectivity constraints. One outcome of their discussion is that an extended and compact representation of the convex hull of directed rooted subtrees when the underlying graph is series-parallel can be derived.\n\nDe Jongh et al. [JGL91] have also worked with a closely related problem in which a pair of nodes has to be linked by two node disjoint paths with minimum total cost and two cable technologies. This problem is a little different from the LAND-2T since for each arc of the network there is only one available technology, that is, each arc has a specified technology and there are arcs of type 1 and arcs of type 2. In the LAND-2T problem, for each arc we have two available technologies. They also consider a transition cost that is associated with each node. This cost is incurred only when a flow enters and leaves the corresponding node on arcs of different types. Two heuristics were proposed in [JGL99] and a lower bounding procedure based on Lagrangean relaxation is provided. These procedures are used in a branch-and-bound strategy to solve the problem.\n\nIn a previous paper, we worked with the local access network design problem [LRM98]. In this article, we studied two formulations of the problem: single commodity flow formulation; multicommodity flow formulation. The problem was solved exactly by CPLEX (with the two formulations), by a branch-and-bound algorithm, by a branch-and-cut algorithm and by a Benders decomposition. The success obtained by Benders decomposition to solve this problem has induced us to extend the algorithm developed to the"}
